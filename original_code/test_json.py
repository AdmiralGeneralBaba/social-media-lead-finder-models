Since the begining I decided it should be about arts (drama, dance, music, musical theater, film and literature because I ve majored all those degrees. (Yep you heard it right). I was thinkink to make tips for a wanna be student in an acting, music dance, film or literature degrees. I was hoping to teach topics you learn in those degrees and make some book, film and song reviews too and a lot of other stuff. Besides that I want to talk about social issues  and social theories like bullshiet jobs, quiet quitting, scarcity principle, personal finance, etc. because I learned to be that way in the acting degree which basically changed my life.  Since I was thinking in a literature section I thought it would be fine if I included those topics even if they weren´t art subjects specially when I get the idea topic from a book in the first place. But after years of just dreaming to make my youtube channel I gratuated from a journalism degree too. At first I just wanna include journalism topics and important news in my country to the art channel but I felt it was getting kinda odd, like it  wasn´t related  to the original art topic. The pandemic leave me without an art job so I got myself a normal  salesperson  job and  learned about digital marketing, ugc and visual design studying on my own. Im a multipotential person and I´ve realized I just can make a second YT channel  focusing on communication topics like journalism, marketing, ugc, media and design. I know making a youtube channel is really hard work but I just dont feel comfortable posting journalism and marketing career  videos in an art channel but to be honest it would be difficult to grow beacause nobody knows me right now and making 2 yt channels of 2 differete topics would be waaaaay more difficult in the first place. Besides that, even though the personal finance and social stuff relates better to the journalism channel I would upload them in the art channel becasue If it weren´t for the acting degree I wouldn´t be interested in those topics at all. I also have thought that maybe some topics could be posted in both channels like vlogs about my everyday life or motivational pursue your dream careerkind of vids What are you thoughts / recommendations? Should I make a miscellaneous one for all channel or 2 channels?\n\nBTW I want the channels to:\n\n1 be a platform to promote my work specially as an artist so I can get more opportunities specially in the acting &amp; performing  world but any art job opportunity would be ideal.\n\n2.-Convert youtube into my full time job alongside streaming, specially videogames.S",

I have amassed a large collection of images and short videos that are relevant to my audience and I would like to pair those with a variety of 15-30 second audio clips of some music that I've made. I am wondering what the most effective way to create all this content. I have done some research and it seems that the majority of information out there is either about Canva bulk create or other AI tools that will cut long-form videos into reels or add captions. Neither is relevant to me as I won't be using captions, instead just visuals and audio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am curious if anyone knows of a service where I can just dump in 100s of audios and pictures and have them combined into 1000s of videos?

When I drive to pick up my son from daycare every day I always use a USB mic to record my thoughts on things that crop up, including topics from that day's video. Today, I recorded about 25 minutes of audio that naturally expanded on the idea of sharing our lives online. I want to upload it as companion content that amplifies my daily vlog. \n\nDo you have any suggestions for how I can accomplish this that isn't too cumbersome for viewers? I did just realize that I could have a playlist and add a title card at the end of the video to redirect to that, but because it's audio-only I'm not sure how well received that will be. I know it seems counter-intuitive, but I don't really care if it gets a lot of traffic. It's just something I naturally do and have done while driving alone.

As a content creator at any event or wedding, your job is to get content of everything yes, but mainly get BTS content. Photographers and Videographers are so focused (rightly so) on the important shots they need to get, they usually don’t have time for BTS stuff. That’s where we come in! Brides and Grooms love shots of them getting ready, fooling around with friends and family, and even content of them GETTING their photos taken.\n\n2. WITH THAT SAID, this is my most important point. Content Creators are NOT there to interfere with any other vendor! It’s so important to go in and introduce yourself to photographers and videographers and let them know you’re not there to intrude. I always explain that I’m there to capture what they may not, and that if they ever need any assistance or need me to move out of the way I’d be more than happy to! It’s so important to build these good relationships with other vendors, because honestly we’re all here for the same goal !\n\n3. The biggest difference between CC and videography/photography is that you typically get all your CC content within 24 hours, usually including some curated reels and/or tik tok’s at the couple’s request. This gives the photographers and videographers a little relief on the pressure they might feel from couples to get their photos and videos back. As long as they have something to post/look at in the meantime, they’re usually happy waiting for the professionally edited photos and videos!\n\n4. Honestly, sometimes having a CC at an event is beneficial to other vendors as well. I work with a few vendors I’ve met along the way who have asked me to capture their own work at events for them!

Having first-hand experience working with storyboard artists the idea behind the Storyboard Creator is not to replace the artist but to speed up ideation turnover and support real-time discussions on creative ideas. The functionality allows you to create a storyboard within minutes, which means that you can turn an idea into a first draft of a storyboard at speed. This means that when you discuss an idea with your client you do not have to deal with the abstract, you can create several storyboards, send them to the client and ask which one is closest to his/her vision.

Up until now I have been running the account from the camera roll on my phone, but I think now would be a good time for me to implement a management platform. I'm at the point where the account is starting to grow a I want to nurture it but I just don't have the time daily. I also want to gain some insight before I hire someone to run it for me.\n\nHere's what I am looking for. A platform that is *reliable* when it comes to posting (set it and forget it). I work a full time job in a completely different industry, I am rarely on social media during the work week. I live and die by time blocking so I am looking for *efficient* platform. I would also like an element of *curation.* I could really use suggestions on content ideas but thats not a deal breaker. After some research I put the list below together but I have no idea which platform would fit my situation best.\n\nPlease help me out, I just want to be great lol. My goal is to grow my personal profiles over the next 2 years and see where the journey takes me. Last thing, I already have consistent content being produced to \"feed the algorithm\" if that makes any difference. Thanks in advance to anyone who leaves any type of feedback.\n\n**Budget:** $100 or less monthly.\n\n**Primary platforms:** IG, FB *(Established)*\n\n**Secondary platforms:** Youtube, TikTok, Twitter, LinkedIn\n\n* My Youtube and TikTok are growing but are fairly new.\n\nThe list of platforms have compiled so far:\n\n* Hootsuite\n* MavSocial\n* Sprout Social\n* Buffer\n* Crowdfire\n* SocialBee\n* Zoho Social\n* Post Planner (better as a curator, not a scheduler)\n* eClincher\n* Social Pilot\n* Sendible\n\n\"What you seek is seeking you.\" - Rumi",

I am excited to share CrowdQuestion with you all understanding that it will give you all a leg up in social promotion. \n\nCrowdQuestion is a brand-new social communication platform focused on connecting crowds to bring everyone closer to their community as well as enhancing any occasion in both the digital and physical world. \n\nOur team has years of experience with growing a following, marketing, gaining awareness, branding, and content creation.

  "body": "16 Tips for Your Content Marketing Strategy\n\n  \nFor anyone who wants some help to step up their social media marketing, these are the tips I will be applying to my new business. \n\n  \nI’m sure some of you will find value in this post, if you need further clarification let me know, I’d be happy to answer any questions :)\n\n  \n(This is a fairly long post, so for those of you that prefer watching to reading, I also have a video about this:  https://youtu.be/fiJFJZysl68 )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Value - Only post content that has value. No one cares about pics of coffee or selfies. The content itself has to contain value, not just the captions. Teach, inspire, explain, show, entertain, wow people, etc.  \n\n2. Focus on them - and what they get out of it. It is not about you. It is about them. The content must be valuable to them. Understand your audience and what they find valuable. What you find and they find valuable may well differ.  \n\n3. Engagement - If content is king, engagement is queen. You must engage with your audience. In the comments, in DMs, but don’t just stop there. Go out find others to engage with. Become a fan of your fans. Boost them up by interacting with their content. It will come back to you 10 fold as they will form greater attachments to you.  \n\n4. Idea lists - Come up with a list of topics your brand can talk about. I put mine in an excel sheet. Focus on the general topics here, not the specifics. You will be making many posts around the same topics so don’t bother coming up with all your content right away. You just need to know the general areas which you can then make content in.  \n\n5. Bulk creation or ‘batching’ - When creating one type of content, don’t just create that one post. Create many of them at once. It will be a more efficient use of your time.   \n\n6. Pre make - Make 1 - 2 weeks worth of content in before hand. Give yourself a buffer so you can absorb the everyday swings of life while keeping that content game strong.   \n\n7. Rhythm - Give your content a rhythm so people know what to expect and when to expect it. But like any great beat, it is the fills the extra spiciness that makes it great. So don’t be afraid to mix it up and throw in some polyrhythms in there.  \n\n8. Schedule - Use something like creator studio or hootsuite to have your content pre loaded and ready to go in advance. Get your entire weeks content scheduled so you don’t have to worry about it each day and you can just focus on that interacting!   \n\n9. Stay coherent - Stay on brand. Know the story you are telling. And make sure you don’t post content that isn’t relevant to it. It may be valuable, but if it isn't coherent to your brands message, don’t post it.   \n\n10. Visuals on point - We are visual creatures. They are more important than your words for social media. Doesn’t matter how valuable your content is, if it looks bad you won’t attract anyone to look at it. Hire designers and artists. Find them anywhere you can, fiver, upwork, instagram, college students. Get them to make everything look awesome for you.   \n\n11. Paid promo, shoutouts + awareness ads - Boost your reach with awareness campaigns. Not pushing products here, just growing your brand and finding new fans.  \n\n12. Once started we don’t stop. Ever. - Once that train leaves the station, there is no going back. If you stop, you die. You can not stop posting content for as long as this business exists.  \n\n13. Squeeze the lemon - squeeze all the juice out of it. Don’t just use that piece of content the one time. If you have made a video, it can be split up and turned into blogs, emails, instagrams, tweets, tiktoks, etc. Squeeze all the life out of that post.  \n\n14. Steal ideas from other great creators - Find great brands doing creative content and reverse engineer and use to make own content. Don’t just copy and paste, but use the principles to come up with your own, but better ;)  \n\n15. Repeat your stories - This is how you never run out of content. Remember no one is paying attention to you. No one will remember your post from yesterday let alone from months ago. But don’t just repost your content again, tell it from different angles. Over and over and over. That is how you build a brand. So they start to connect that story with your business in their mind. Pick your story, and tell it often.  \n\n16. Focus on main channels - at the start don’t try go after all platforms that will be too much for you. Focus on your main ones, the ones you know the best. Once they have grown and are stable, then expand into the others. For me I am starting with Instagram and TikTok, but then will move into email, twitter and YouTube. Facebook is basically dead, but content will be reposted from other channels onto it. Eventually, I will push into podcasts, Pinterest, snapchat, etc…",

But like any great beat, it is the fills the extra spiciness that makes it great. So don’t be afraid to mix it up and throw in some polyrhythms in there.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schedule - Use something like creator studio or hootsuite to have your content pre loaded and ready to go in advance. Get your entire weeks content scheduled so you don’t have to worry about it each day and you can just focus on that interacting!   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay coherent - Stay on brand. Know the story you are telling. And make sure you don’t post content that isn’t relevant to it. It may be valuable, but if it isn&amp;#39;t coherent to your brands message, don’t post it.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visuals on point - We are visual creatures. They are more important than your words for social media. Doesn’t matter how valuable your content is, if it looks bad you won’t attract anyone to look at it. Hire designers and artists. Find them anywhere you can, fiver, upwork, instagram, college students. Get them to make everything look awesome for you.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paid promo, shoutouts + awareness ads - Boost your reach with awareness campaigns. Not pushing products here, just growing your brand and finding new fans.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once started we don’t stop. Ever. - Once that train leaves the station, there is no going back. If you stop, you die. You can not stop posting content for as long as this business exists.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squeeze the lemon - squeeze all the juice out of it. Don’t just use that piece of content the one time. If you have made a video, it can be split up and turned into blogs, emails, instagrams, tweets, tiktoks, etc. Squeeze all the life out of that post.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steal ideas from other great creators - Find great brands doing creative content and reverse engineer and use to make own content. Don’t just copy and paste, but use the principles to come up with your own, but better ;)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat your stories - This is how you never run out of content. Remember no one is paying attention to you. No one will remember your post from yesterday let alone from months ago. But don’t just repost your content again, tell it from different angles. Over and over and over. That is how you build a brand. So they start to connect that story with your business in their mind. Pick your story, and tell it often.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus on main channels - at the start don’t try go after all platforms that will be too much for you. Focus on your main ones, the ones you know the best. Once they have grown and are stable, then expand into the others. For me I am starting with Instagram and TikTok, but then will move into email, twitter and YouTube. Facebook is basically dead, but content will be reposted from other channels onto it. Eventually, I will push into podcasts, Pinterest, snapchat, etc…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Users find pages with more followers more trustworthy.\n\n10k+followers = Unclocked features on Instagram\n\n30k+ followers = Influencer\n\nMore followers = More clients\n\n**4-  CAROUSEL IS DYING**\n\nNope.

There are rules.\n\n1- Instagram favors posts that do not contain a lot of text on the photo.\n\n2- Instagram knows when you are posting a copied post.\n\n3- Instagram is implementing a system to detect when the photo is not related to the content or when the content is fake.\n\n4- Instagram favors structured posts using well-structured hashtags, tagged to the right people, post at the right time.\n\n**6 - FOLLOW/UNFOLLOW OR BUY FOLLOWERS**\n\nThis method can get you a couple of new followers, but most of these followers are not interested in your content.

  "parsedCommunityName": "socialmedia_marketing",
  "body": "For anyone who wants to step up their online marketing, these are more intermediate to advanced tips, but no reason people early on in their entrepreneurial journey couldn’t try applying some of them\n\nI’m sure some of you will find value in this post, if you need further clarification let me know, I’d be happy to answer any questions :)\n\n(This is a fairly long post, so for those of you that prefer watching to reading, I also have a video about this:  https://youtu.be/urwV54DZVTI )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**No. 1 - Better advertising campaigns**\n\nParticularly focusing on Facebook and Instagram. I am assuming most people can know how to run basic ads and use their pixel data, do retargeting etc. I find a lot of people are trying to do adverts wrong. Trying to sell from the get go, then retargeting trying to sell again, maybe even offering discounts. And that is understandable, but it is not a good approach. \n\nIt typically takes 7 different interactions with your business to convert someone from cold to a sale. 7! One or two ads just won’t cut it. And 7 different interactions, showing them the same advert again only counts as one. \n\nFor the sake of this we will only count ads as interactions, but any different interaction would normally count. So when you are setting up your campaigns you need to have this in mind. Think of it like a story. \n\nThe first few ads, 1, 2, 3, they are creating the hook, laying the context, showcasing what the brand stands for. Short and sweet. Don’t be trying to push people to your website here, don’t pay for link clicks, pay for engagement. It's far cheaper. (You can have a link, but have a specific landing page for it, not a hard hitting sales pitch, but something that showcases the brand.) It’s all about awareness here. But 3 different ads doing it, not one.\n\nAds 4, 5, these are now creating the problem, creating the conflict. Use that pixel data to do retargeting to the people who interacted in the first ads. Don’t give them the solution yet. Have a different landing page for these ads again. \n\nFinally ads 6, 7, these are now were you can highlight your solution, you give them the resolve to that problem that has been festering inside them over many days. It is the resolve to the story. These ads are only for people who clicked on ads 4, 5. Then you can bring them to a landing page where you have your sales pitch (bonus tip, do that in a video, people don’t like to read.) Your conversion rates for these people will be far higher now. \n\nThe advertising process is a journey, bring people along that story. \n\nRemember: Awareness, Leads, Conversions. Awareness, Leads, Conversions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**No. 2 -  Post Sale Relationships**\n\nMost of your marketing effort, 70%, should be going into the post sale relationship. \n\nMake ads that share the story of your brand. Let them reinforce their beliefs about you. Share the stories of people benefiting your products. Create valuable content around your industry. Post all over social platforms. You need to keep yourself constantly in their mind, so the next time they are in the market for your business, you are the first people they think of. And when their friends are in the market for your business, you get recommended. (That is very powerful, recommended by a friend. It creates immediate trust. If their friends trust it, there is no risk for them so they trust it too.) \n\nEmail marketing is also done here, the process for effective email marketing is: 1 get permission, 2 add value, 3 make it personal, 4 repeat. Don’t be pitching or pushing products in your ads constantly. There is a time and place for doing that. But 80% of your emails should just be over delivering value to your audience. Then when you do have a new product out, you can run a specific email campaign for that. But don’t just shove products and sales and discounts in their face. That is the quickest way for your open rates to drop to embarrassing levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**No. 3 - Collaborations**\n\nCollaborate on social media with complimentary businesses. Then go out and create specific awesome content with them. This leverages each others following to great effect. E.g. if you sell chocolates, work with a flower shop. Flowers and chocolates go hand in hand. You may need to work out a business deal here if it is not on equal footing. \n\nYou can also try the opposite of collaborations. Go to war with your competition. People love drama, people love conflict, it is at the heart of all stories. People can not be helped but drawn in. And creates great awareness for both brands. People pick sides and argue about it in the comments. Amazing for your interactions. \n\nThink Mac vs PC, or last year when Burger King comes out with the not a Big Mac range cause McDonalds lost the legal battle to trademark a Big Mac.  \n\nPeople also love an underdog vs giant story, if your competition is way to big for you to go head to head with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**No. 4 - Competitions and giveaways**\n\nNow don’t just create some crappy campaign where you get people to like and share and follow to enter. That is redundant as a tactic. I’ve made that mistake myself. All you end up with is people who just want free stuff and will never interact with your business again. So then in the future you end up with a load of dead followers, so any post you put out gets very few interactions and then is shown to even less people. You just end up hurting yourself. \n\nYou want to create competitions where it celebrates who you are as a brand. Where it is an effort to enter. And that effort is shared on there social page with you tagged as an entry. Creating the viral effect. For example, if you sell skateboarding apparel, people should have to learn a skateboarding trick to enter. Something they already want to do. This is now extra motivation. They have to showcase them learning it in a video post to enter. All their friends see it, and what are their friends into, skateboarding too. So your brand spreads, as they are likely to want to enter in to.  And as well as the prize, you showcase the winners on your page, so they get a shoutout, everyone wants more followers ;) Plus give discounts to everyone who enters. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**No. 5 - Focus on the heart not the aesthetics**\n\nGo deep, shallow surface level crap has no value. 100s or 1000s of post like that on people's feeds. Be the stories that matter. Teenagers pages are full of memes, and adults are full of gym selfies and their friends trip to Thailand 4 years ago. \n\nFind the stories that go deeper, that connect with people on emotional level to do with your brand. Stand out by being the only one that posts with heart!",

So then in the future you end up with a load of dead followers, so any post you put out gets very few interactions and then is shown to even less people. You just end up hurting yourself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You want to create competitions where it celebrates who you are as a brand. Where it is an effort to enter. And that effort is shared on there social page with you tagged as an entry. Creating the viral effect. For example, if you sell skateboarding apparel, people should have to learn a skateboarding trick to enter. Something they already want to do. This is now extra motivation. They have to showcase them learning it in a video post to enter. All their friends see it, and what are their friends into, skateboarding too. So your brand spreads, as they are likely to want to enter in to.  And as well as the prize, you showcase the winners on your page, so they get a shoutout, everyone wants more followers ;) Plus give discounts to everyone who enters. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No. 5 - Focus on the heart not the aesthetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go deep, shallow surface level crap has no value. 100s or 1000s of post like that on people&amp;#39;s feeds. Be the stories that matter. Teenagers pages are full of memes, and adults are full of gym selfies and their friends trip to Thailand 4 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find the stories that go deeper, that connect with people on emotional level to do with your brand. Stand out by being the only one that posts with heart!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It all started when Russians found a loophole that Instagram doesn't limit story viewing actions. They are also the first to make public bots capable of viewing 100s of thousands up to a few millions of stories per day.\n\nAnyways, a few days ago (on October 16th) Instagram finally decided to put an end to it, and everyone using these tools got the \"Account Compromised Message\" so most of the people stopped. After that, I've seen a ton of people all around complaining about story views drop but in reality, it's just that all the strangers stopped viewing stories and that's the main reason for the sudden story views drop.\n\nI've made a video covering what exactly happened and also explaining more about this mass viewing method if someone is interested you can check it out here: [https://youtu.be/8cEDBz6\\_75A](https://youtu.be/8cEDBz6_75A)\n\nIf you were using this and got the account compromised message I really advise you to stop completely and to pause all actions for a day or two. The account compromised message definitely affects trust and health score negatively.\n\nAgain, I'm explaining everything a bit more in-depth in the video above, so if you have time &amp; want to know more, check it out.\n\nIf linking is against the rules of this sub, please delete this post.\n\nHave you tried mass viewing and did you got the account compromised message?

  "body": "As I've promised, I've transcribed my YT video about methods to fix the action block on Instagram, and I'm going to post it here, for those of you who like to learn by reading instead of watching.\n\nFor those of you who like to learn by watching and listening here is the link to my YouTube video: [https://youtu.be/f\\_05rDTmvvw](https://youtu.be/f_05rDTmvvw)\n\nIf you like to learn by reading (or you just don't like my bad English in the video) then continue reading.\n\nThis is part two of my previous video/ post where I've explained what triggers action blocks on Instagram, and what should you do to completely avoid them. In that video/ post I've mentioned that there are 3 different types of action blocks now depending on the type of action block you've received you will know if you are going to be able to fix it using some of the methods I'm going to mention later or you have to just wait it out.\n\nBefore I go over different types of action blocks I want to mention that Instagram's AI started to go pretty crazy with these blocks recently, probably because they are still tweaking settings, and pretty often they are Falsely flagging users and blocking their actions without a real reason. If you are just a regular user, and you absolutely did nothing wrong, make sure to report a problem to Instagram, and your action block is going to be fixed most of the times. If you've tried that already or you think you did something wrong than continue reading.\n\n**Different types of action blocks:**\n\n1. **Temporary action block**: This one is usually the most common and expires pretty fast from several hours to 24h. Methods I'm going to mention later work pretty well with this type of action block.\n2. **Action block with an expiration date:** this one has the time stamp saying when exactly it's going to expire. Methods I'm going to mention later usually have pretty low success rate with this type of action blocks and your best bet is to wait it out. Sometimes however it can be fixed, but in general, it's pretty rare. \n3. **Action block without an expiration date:** This one is usually the worst, since it doesn't have an expiration date and can last from several hours to two weeks. Some of the fixing methods usually work with this one, which is great since if you just wait it out you can lose up to two weeks. Now since I've covered that and you know your chances of getting the action block lifted, let's go over different methods you should try to fix the action block.\n\n**Method #1**\n\nI've already mentioned this, but I want to mention it again since when we were testing we had the most success with it. Send a request to IG to manually review your account once the action block msg pops up. You should absolutely do this, even if you are doing follow unfollow or spamming with comments or likes. As I've mentioned Instagram is fighting with bots and when you request a manual review or report a problem, it will definitely let Instagram know that you are not a bot. With this method, we got unblock success rate of almost 50% and we did spam with actions, so it definitely works. Sometimes, you won't get the option to request a manual review on the action block msg, but you can go to settings&gt;Help&gt;Report a problem and explain that you can't like or follow and you don't know why because you did nothing wrong.\n\n**Method #2**\n\nI've already mentioned that you should use Instagram manually and stop with automation if you haven't already delete all 3rd party apps and tools and change your IG password. This can lift your action block and definitely help avoid another in the future.\n\n**Pro Tip**: Turn on Two-factor authentification, this will let Instagram know that you are probably not using 3rd party bots and tools, and it will increase your trust and health score + it can lift the action block immediately.\n\n**Method #3**\n\nRewrite your BIO and remove link from your BIO if you have one this worked for one of my friends recently, it's easy and there's no reason not to try it. In the [previous video](https://youtu.be/89vuQbrfLao), I've mentioned that a link in BIO increases your chances to get the action block. \n\n**Method #4**\n\nDelete Instagram App and install it again (This should delete the cookies and other things that Instagram is capturing. We had some success lifting temporary action blocks with this one and I've also seen people of forums mentioning that it worked for them. Pretty easy to do and there's no reason not to try it.\n\n**Method #5**\n\nSwitch to 4g, as I've already mentioned we've noticed that it's easier to get action blocked while using your home IP than 4G mobile internet, and if that's the reason you got the action block this should fix it.\n\n**Method #6**\n\nYou can go one step further and switch the device you are using and try to log in on some other phone or tablet, sometimes even logging on PC helps. We had a high success rate of fixing action blocks without an expiration date and temporary blocks with this one.\n\n**Method #7**\n\nLink your Instagram account to a facebook page and if that doesn't help switch from personal to business or creator and vice-versa. As I've mentioned we have noticed that IG accounts which have been linked to a facebook page seem to have higher action limit, business accounts have even higher limit and finally creator accounts seem to have the highest limit so if this doesn't help remove action block immediately, it can definitely help to prevent another action block once you get unblocked.\n\n**Method #8**\n\nIf you have some money, promote one of your posts, this has lifted action blocks for us in several cases, and I've also mentioned in the previous video that accounts who spend some money on ads have higher action limits which should also help you avoid another action block in the future. If none of these methods work for you then unfortunately you will have to wait it out. As I've mentioned sometimes action block message comes with the expiration date and sometimes it doesn't. Action blocks usually last from 12 to 48 hours, but sometimes they can last for up to two weeks. If that's the case and you don't want to wait that long, you can start working on another account while you're waiting to get unblocked. Don't forget to check my previous video on how to avoid action blocks: [https://youtu.be/89vuQbrfLao](https://youtu.be/89vuQbrfLao) If you like to read instead of watching, you can find my previous post here on this sub or check my blog post: [What Triggers The Action Block And How To Avoid It](https://equalscash.com/what-triggers-action-block-on-instagram-and-how-to-avoid-it/) and if you have another device I would advise you to start the new account on that device using mobile data. Right now, unfortunately, there's nothing else you can do, but since I've seen a lot of people complaining about action blocks on their personal accounts where they actually have done nothing wrong, I'm sure IG will take it a bit easier in the future, because they are really starting to get their users angry.\n\nAs I've mentioned in [my video](https://youtu.be/f_05rDTmvvw), follow-unfollow method if done right still works, even better now, since a lot of people that were botting stopped with IG marketing completely, and people are getting much fewer notifications and follow spam. For Instagram marketers who are doing things correctly, these action blocks are really a good thing, and IMO we will be able to grow even faster now.\n\nThese blocks are only bad for regular users, who actually did nothing wrong, but as I've mentioned, I'm sure IG is tweaking their criteria and soon, there will be much fewer instances of False flagging and action blocks for regular users.\n\nI hope you liked this post and that it will help you remove the action block from your IG account.\n\nI really hope you don't mind that I've put some links to my video since I know there are people who like to by watching/ listening more than by reading. I also want to mention that if I find out about some other methods that are working to remove the action block, I will update [the article about action block fixes](https://equalscash.com/remove-action-block-on-instagram/) on my blog.\n\nThese methods combined yielded 87% success rate for us, and since all of these methods are easy and fast to do, I suggest you try all of them.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask and I'm going to answer as soon as I can.",

  "communityName": "r/socialmedia_marketing",

  "body": "I've promised that I will make a post about this, so here we go.\n\nYou are probably aware that since June 2019 Instagram really started to tighten their rules, and prevent people from spamming and botting, since I'm a member of a private skype group dedicated to IG marketing, me and some of my friends from this group did some extensive testing to see what triggers these action blocks right now and what are the things that can be done to decrease chances or completely avoid getting action blocked. So let's first start with **what can trigger the action block**.\n\nBtw, I've made a video covering this in-depth, so if you like to consume content by watching a video here you go: [https://youtu.be/89vuQbrfLao](https://youtu.be/89vuQbrfLao)\n\nAn action block is usually triggered by the number of actions you've been doing per hour and per day on your account. Now the limit is quite different and so far we've figured out it depends on a lot of different things, so let's go over these triggers first:\n\n1. **Account Age** \\- The more age your account has the more actions you will be able to perform. We've seen big increases in daily actions after the account reaches 1 month of age, 3 months of age and 12 months of age.\n2. **Authority** in terms of followers, posts and your overall engagement rate. The more followers you have and engagement the more actions you are able to do. 1-month-old accounts with let's say 5k followers and good engagement rate are usually able to do more daily actions than 1-month-old accounts with 500 followers. Also, you need to have at least several published posts, accounts that are empty or have only 1-2 posts usually get the action block much faster.\n3. **IP Address** your IP address also plays a role in daily action limit and we've noticed that accounts which use 4G mobile data while performing actions usually have the ability to do more daily actions than the ones on home IP address. It also seems that the total amount of accounts you are running from the same IP address, especially if it's home network play a role in the daily action limit.\n4. **Previous violations** If the account had previous action blocks, action limit decreases. We are not sure how long the account stays flagged from previous violations. But we've also noticed that violations on one account, can also affect other accounts that are being used on the same device and IP address.\n5. **Usage of 3rd party tools and apps** I've mentioned this before and you probably know this, but using 3rd party tools, apps and bots definitely lowers your account health score and it's easily detectable by Instagram and not only that this lowers your action limit, it can also be the sole cause of the action blocks.\n6. **A link in bio**: Accounts with a link in BIO usually have lower action limit than accounts without.\n7. **Overall account health score** I will make another video on what affects the account health score, but obviously lower health score affects your action limit negatively.\n8. **Type of actions you are performing** not all actions carry the same amount of weight, DMs and Comments carry the most weight after that follows than unfollows and than likes. You probably knew this already but for example, you can perform more likes per hour and per day than follows, comments and DMs. Another thing that increases the chance of getting action blocked is if you are performing the same type of actions without mixing things up. So if you are following every day and only do that no likes, comments, DMs and so on, you will more likely trigger the action block\n9. **Type of the account**: It seems that business and creator accounts are less likely to get hit with the action block than personal accounts of the same age and authority. Also, accounts that are linked to a facebook page have less chance to trigger the action block than accounts that are not linked. And finally, business and creator accounts that have to spend money on ads have the lowest ability to trigger the action block... I'm wondering why xD\n10. **Your activity level** It also seems that Instagram is tracking your overall activity level and time you spend in the app browsing. If you let's say only open Instagram every two hours for 1 minute to follow a certain amount of people, and that's it, your daily action limit decreases dramatically.\n\nThere is one more trigger which I'm going to call a random factor. I are not really sure what that is, if it's a something we've missed, or Instagram really does this randomly in order to hide how their algorithm actually works and the exact number of actions you are able to perform but this is something I've noticed before as well and it's not just related to action limit but to other things as well such as post-performance in hashtags and on the explore page, IG TV videos performance, Ranking stories with hashtags and so on. This wouldn't really surprise me since I know Google actually has the same thing with their algorithm which is called random ranking factor and it does make sense since if you add some sort of randomness, it gets much harder to manipulate the algorithm.\n\nWhen you know what can trigger the action block, it's pretty easy to figure out what you can do to avoid it, but if you want to hear what exactly we've figured out, and my own action limit recommendations check my video on YT: [https://youtu.be/89vuQbrfLao](https://youtu.be/89vuQbrfLao)\n\nIt really took us a lot of work to figure these things out, and I know you guys hate self-promo, so I've transcribed almost half of my video and put it here on this sub. I really hope I won't get downvotes just because I've put a link to a completely free video that's actually helpful. In a few days, I am also going to publish a guide on how to fix the action block instantly (it only works for certain types of action blocks). I will be posting my methods to fix it here as well if I don't get hate for this post because I know a lot of people here are pretty sensitive and I think I don't really deserve to get negative karma for trying to help completely free. I really hope you understand that.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, I will answer as soon as I can.\n\nI really hope this data will help you guys.",

And blessed enough to know **three of the best ways to use Instagram on computer.**\n\n\\#1- Instagooo Tool to access Instagram on Computer\n\nInstagooo offers an on-line and web-based tool with a variety of applications. With this tool, you will be able to manage Instagram posts and comments from your desktop. You can **access your published posts**, **make drafts,** and **schedule your posts** by the post scheduling tool of Instagooo.\n\nAccess your published posts on Insatgram\n\nIn this section of Instagooo automation tool you can:\n\n1. See all of your posts;\n2. Select your posts to take collective actions;\n3. Create a copy of your posts;\n4. Delete your posts;\n5. Select your time zone; and\n6. Post photos and videos on your Instagram account.\n\nFor a more detailed control over your posts, you can click on the body of one of the posts and have the following controls:\n\n1. Add a location to your post;\n2. Tag people in your photo or video;\n3. Buy likes and views for your post from real Instagram accounts;\n4. Edit your caption;\n5. See the comments; and\n6. Add a comment.\n\nMake drafts on Instagram\n\nYou can also create drafts of your posts to publish them anytime in the future:\n\n1. Go to the post section of Instagooo;\n2. Select the “Draft Posts” button;\n3. Then select your files to be uploaded to the tool.\n\nIf you have selected multiple files, you can decide to create one single album of those files or create a draft for every single file you have chosen. Please **Do not** select any of the uploaded files and **Do Not** click “next.” You will be directed to the next page automatically once the files are uploaded.\n\nuploading images on Instagooo might take a few seconds. Please do not click anything after the upload is completed. You will automatically be directed to the next page\n\nNow you are directed to this page:\n\nHere, you can determine more settings for your post\n\nAs you see in the image above, you can:\n\n1. Write caption(s) for your post(s);\n2. Apply aspect ratio, filters, and watermarks to your post(s);\n3. Set the publishing date and time of each post (which also lets you schedule your post for future publication); and\n4. Apply other complementary options.\n\nSchedule Instagram posts\n\nYou can create multiple posts (there is no limitation with the number of drafts you generate) and schedule them to publish later, in a specific date and time. All you need to do is to:\n\n1. Go to the post section of the Instagooo automation tool;\n2. Click “scheduled posts”; and\n3. Select and upload files.\n\nThe of it is as explained in “making drafts.”\n\nUsing Instagooo not only allows you access your Instagram on the computer desktop, but also will help an organic and steady growth of your account if the **Instagram promotion feature** is activated for you.\n\n**Downsides of this method:**\n\n* You have no access to the messages sent to you;\n* You have no access to Instagram setting.\n\n\\#2- Using the Inspect Element Feature on Web-Based Instagram\n\nYou can also access your Instagram account on a PC desktop if you know how to use the Inspect Element feature on the Instagram web. If you don’t know how, follow the steps mentioned below:\n\n* Go to Instagram.com on your PC browser and log-in to your account;\n* When logged in, right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect element**;\n* Select the icon which shows the mobile/tablet mode;\n* Now select the phone model you want the page to be responsive for;\n* Refresh the page; and\n* Close the Inspect Element panel.\n\nWeb inspect element will be available by right-clicking anywhere on the page.\n\nNow you can see your messages and message people, post your photos, and do whatever your phone can do to Instagram.\n\n**Downsides of this method:**\n\n* There is no possibility of scheduling your posts;\n* The setting is limited compared to the phone Instagram;\n* Business account Insights are not present in this method;\n* You can’t manage multiple accounts.\n\n\\#3- Getting Help from Third Part Apps\n\nThere are also many third-party apps that help you emulate android and iOS on a pc. Using these applications, you will be able to run any mobile app, including Instagram on your computer desktop. The most well-known of these apps are BlueStacks and Nox for emulating android applications, and Appetize and Ripple for running iOS applications on Windows and macOS.\n\n**Downsides of this method:**\n\n* You are dependent on a third party app to manage your Instagram account;\n* These applications consume a part of your system’s speed, so the speed and performance of your PC might drop to some degree; and\n* To upload an Instagram story, you need to have a web-cam on your computer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUsing Instagram on computer desktop makes it very easy to manage your Instagram account, and these three ways (Instagooo Dashboard, Instagram Web Inspect Element, and Third party application) makes it entirely possible. However, no method is complete by itself. Maybe the best way to manage your Instagram account on a desktop is to combine two or all of these methods to get the best results.\n\n**Our best suggestion is: To use your Instagram on computer through “Inspect element” and manage it by “Instagooo dashboard”.**\n\n**Source:** [**https://instagooo.com/blog/tutorial/three-simple-ways-to-use-instagram-on-computer-postdm-and-all/**](https://instagooo.com/blog/tutorial/three-simple-ways-to-use-instagram-on-computer-postdm-and-all/)",

  "body": " \n\nSocial media marketing can create quality leads and drive sales to your brand, or on the other hand, it can be a big waste of time and a task-oriented dud! It depends on how you use it. You should know how to create, manage and measure your overall plans.\n\nIf you are trying to achieve successful social media marketing, then you must overcome a few common challenges. Spending enough time, creating high-quality content and measuring the results are all important if you mishandle them, they will cause you troubles.\n\nBut don’t worry, we have a step by step plan that would help you go through it.\n\n**1-Identify your social media marketing goals**\n\nYou should start with your goal setting before anything to be successful in [social media marketing](https://il.ink/). So, use a smart goal setting strategy to create a foundation for your social media marketing.\n\nYour goals should be:\n\n* **Unique and specific**: goals like “get more ” doesn’t help you pinpoint your objective. Goals should nail down precisely what is expected of the initiative.\n* **Relevant**: your social media marketing goals must tie into your overall goals. Goals like building an audience, increasing website traffic or boosting your brand. Just make sure your goal related to the bigger picture.\n* **Measurable**: you should be able to find out if you reach your goal or you missed the\n* **Attainable**: your goals shouldn’t be out of reach. Don’t go overboard with expectations.\n\n📷\n\n**2-Identify your main audience**\n\nYour content won’t be useful unless it’s crafted explicitly for who you are trying to target.\n\n* **Bring down the pain points**: you should make everything more comfortable for your buyers.\n* **Customer support survey:** talk to your audience. What is their most common question? By knowing this, you can take in the content which is engaging and interests your targets.\n\n**3-Select the best platform**\n\nYou shouldn’t try to cultivate followers on all social media channels. Because the managing of them can get overwhelming and a waste of time.\n\nTo find the best [social media platform](https://il.ink/) for your business, you should consider two things:\n\n* **Who is my audience?:** you should know your audience to find out which platform is more suitable for your social media marketing.\n* **Where are my competitors?:** find out which channels your competitors are using and look at their followers. You should be on every channel they are on.\n\nSuccessful social media marketing needs a lot of time to manage, so it’s better for you to choose one or two channels and invest only in them than five channels and spread the message to thin!\n\n📷\n\n**4-Be consistent**\n\nYou should be consistent on your social media platform, or your audience will quickly forget you.\n\n* **Write content:** keep your audience in mind while creating content. Blogs and webinar invitations are smart choices.\n* **Curate content:** post relevant information and articles written by others to fill your social media calendar, but don’t be sales-y.\n* **Listen to your audience:** use social media platforms to listen to what competitors and your audience are interested in.\n\n**5-Grow your followers**\n\nThe more people see your content, the more result you will give. You should work on increasing followers on your social media channels that are relevant to your product or service.\n\n* **Current customers:** just make sure your existing happy customers are following your social media account. Product updates, industry information and your new content are essential for customers.\n* **Potential customers:** people who scroll around and read your content and are likely to follow you. It’s important to encourage them to subscribe to your blog or follow your social account for future updates. You can use contests to gain followers on these audiences.\n* **Advertisements:** ads are an excellent way to reach your customers who would otherwise never come into following you.\n* **Social media automation tools:** you can use automation tools available for your social media account to promote your brand and use less time online**.**\n\n**6-Engage your followers**\n\nIf you want to be successful in social media marketing, you need to find a way to increase engagement with your audience.\n\n* **Tag them:** if you know someone from your followers who are interested in specific information, tag them on your relevant posts. This shows them touches and lets you increase the quality of your social media effort.\n* **Respond:** social media is a two-way street, you should respond personally to your followers, answer their questions, comment and like other posts.\n* **Links:** include [links in your posts](https://il.ink/), let your followers know what you want them to do next. Link to your website, blogs or other CTA (call-to-action). You can use some platforms to create a source page for your links and place the general link on your bio anywhere you want.\n* **Use hashtags:** let people find you by searching hashtags related to your business. Use different hashtags (not too much) to grow your followers and build good brand awareness.\n\n**7-Monitor your results**\n\nBreak the loop by holding up the results to your goals and see how they compare. Or else, you won’t know which strategies are working and which ones don’t.\n\n* **Follower numbers:** total up the amount of your new received followers on each social media platform, and compare it to your goals. If you are interesting enough, you will consistently gain new followers.\n* **Engagements**: measure the number of likes, comments, and shares from your audience. Find out which content gets the most significant\n* **Clicks and hits**: you should analyze which one of your links is more popular, and which one has the most significant hits! This way you will know your followers take the next step or not.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nSuccessful social media marketing affects a lot on your business, but it needs the right strategies and a lot of effort.

  "communityName": "r/socialmedia_marketing",

  "body": "**What is social media?**\n\nSocial media is in essence an internet based, virtual means of communication. This technology enables the sharing of digital information (text, photos, videos, audio, etc) with the primary use being communication through text. Social media was originally developed as a tool to enhance the methods of communication between people, often falling under the categories of friends and family. As social media platforms began to show their true potential, through exponential growth in popularity and use, it was not long before its advantage to businesses was made apparent. As it became easier for people to associate themselves to even narrower groups within social media, businesses found it easier to find their targeted audiences. \n\nThe role that social media plays in assisting businesses is significant. The wealth of information and ability to categorise this information, affords companies’ the possibility to implement multiple niche market based strategies. Social media therefore focuses marketing strategies. Social media also decreases the amount of time taken to develop and implement marketing strategies. Another very important aspect to social media which works closely with business is loyalty. Without brand loyalty there is a risk of your company getting ignored. Your competitors will reach the hyper targeted audience that you have. Without your involvement, your audiences’ mindshare will be owned by your competitors. Non-involvement has been coined by the general viewer as negligence on the companies’ part - towards its client base. No public trust in this regard means no business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why social media?**\n\nThere is a multitude of benefits that social media has to offer businesses. Increased brand awareness being the biggest benefit. On the surface you get exposure through advertising through these platforms. The often unforeseen benefits are the content shares and interactions, that your business might get from satisfied customers. It is therefore possible to have adverts multiply rapidly and instantly, with every mention and share by customers through social media. Another benefit of social media for business is statistics. Social media can offer your brand insight to how your product is performing and where your clients are most satisfied. Differences between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 can further this point. \n\nSocial media is based on “Web 2.0” which is the term for the current, newer generation of internet. Web 2.0 encourages the active participation of information sharing as well as collaboration between sites. The evolution of the World Wide Web, has seen certain business standards change. In the former Web 1.0 information was static for the most part. Changes in displayed information were slow and websites served a purpose similar to a poster. Websites in Web 2.0 are more dynamic and rapid changing. Verification and integration within Web 2.0 have set the standards higher for social media marketing strategies. Fast moving platforms (microblogging) now offer a company (regardless of size) a chance at spreading messages like wildfire. Conversations about a specific industry or the nature of a specific company are currently taking place. Microblogging offers company owners the opportunity to lead the direction of these conversations, towards their benefit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How popular is social media?**\n\nThe following platforms have approximately the following numbers of users.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Facebook &gt; 2,1 billion users\n* Youtube &gt; 1,5 billion users\n* WeChat &gt; 980 million users\n* Instagram &gt; 800 million users\n* Tumblr &gt; 794 million users\n* Twitter &gt; 330 million users\n\nTo name a few, however the list goes on and is often updated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Where is social media going?**\n\nSocial media is currently in the process of evolution. As new technologies come to form, one thing is for certain. The possibilities of communicating your message to your audience could only get better.\n\nAs Mark Zuckerburg put it:\n\n“Think about what people are doing on Facebook today. They’re keeping up with their friends and family, but they’re also building an image and identity for themselves, which in a sense is their brand. They’re connecting with the audience that they want to connect to. It’s almost a disadvantage if you’re not on it now.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you liked this post, please feel free to visit my page:\n\n[www.smm-africa.com](https://www.smm-africa.com)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

As social media platforms began to show their true potential, through exponential growth in popularity and use, it was not long before its advantage to businesses was made apparent. As it became easier for people to associate themselves to even narrower groups within social media, businesses found it easier to find their targeted audiences. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The role that social media plays in assisting businesses is significant. The wealth of information and ability to categorise this information, affords companies’ the possibility to implement multiple niche market based strategies. Social media therefore focuses marketing strategies. Social media also decreases the amount of time taken to develop and implement marketing strategies. Another very important aspect to social media which works closely with business is loyalty. Without brand loyalty there is a risk of your company getting ignored. Your competitors will reach the hyper targeted audience that you have. Without your involvement, your audiences’ mindshare will be owned by your competitors. Non-involvement has been coined by the general viewer as negligence on the companies’ part - towards its client base. No public trust in this regard means no business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why social media?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a multitude of benefits that social media has to offer businesses. Increased brand awareness being the biggest benefit. On the surface you get exposure through advertising through these platforms. The often unforeseen benefits are the content shares and interactions, that your business might get from satisfied customers. It is therefore possible to have adverts multiply rapidly and instantly, with every mention and share by customers through social media. Another benefit of social media for business is statistics. Social media can offer your brand insight to how your product is performing and where your clients are most satisfied. Differences between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 can further this point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Social media is based on “Web 2.0” which is the term for the current, newer generation of internet. Web 2.0 encourages the active participation of information sharing as well as collaboration between sites. The evolution of the World Wide Web, has seen certain business standards change. In the former Web 1.0 information was static for the most part. Changes in displayed information were slow and websites served a purpose similar to a poster. Websites in Web 2.0 are more dynamic and rapid changing. Verification and integration within Web 2.0 have set the standards higher for social media marketing strategies. Fast moving platforms (microblogging) now offer a company (regardless of size) a chance at spreading messages like wildfire. Conversations about a specific industry or the nature of a specific company are currently taking place. Microblogging offers company owners the opportunity to lead the direction of these conversations, towards their benefit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How popular is social media?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following platforms have approximately the following numbers of users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Facebook &amp;gt; 2,1 billion users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Youtube &amp;gt; 1,5 billion users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;WeChat &amp;gt; 980 million users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Instagram &amp;gt; 800 million users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tumblr &amp;gt; 794 million users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Twitter &amp;gt; 330 million users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To name a few, however the list goes on and is often updated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where is social media going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Social media is currently in the process of evolution. As new technologies come to form, one thing is for certain. The possibilities of communicating your message to your audience could only get better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Mark Zuckerburg put it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Think about what people are doing on Facebook today. They’re keeping up with their friends and family, but they’re also building an image and identity for themselves, which in a sense is their brand. They’re connecting with the audience that they want to connect to. It’s almost a disadvantage if you’re not on it now.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you liked this post, please feel free to visit my page:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.smm-africa.com\"&gt;www.smm-africa.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

  "body": "Hi. We would like to run a campaign on a Facebook page that would involve us making a certain graphic element public to the audience only after a certain period of time after it was started. This would require changing the graphics from previous posts to new ones, for example, 2 weeks after they were posted on the page. Is this possible? Surprisingly I think so, but does it affect the reach of the post or, for example, the number of responses? We might as well replace the cute kitty graphic with some controversial content and the post stays as it was? This seems strange to me. ",

  "communityName": "r/SocialMediaMarketing",
  "parsedCommunityName": "SocialMediaMarketing",
  "body": "Hello Redditors!\r  \n\r  \nIn the past 5 years of my journey as a digital marketing manager I have seen several businesses fail on social media just because they can’t figure out that one mistake that they are making. Business owners read tons of guides about ‘what to do’ on social media but according to my personal experience ‘what not to do’ is as important, if not more, for a successful digital marketing strategy. \r  \n\r  \nI will try to include all the mistakes that I have personally made and the ones that I have seen other businesses make. Feel free to give your inputs in the comments and I will keep updating this post with your valuable inputs!.\r  \n\r  \nHopefully this post will help you notice all the things that are holding you back.\r  \n\r  \nLet’s Get Started!\r  \n\r  \n1) Neglect Content Quality:\r  \n\r  \nShare low-quality, irrelevant content that adds no value to your audience. Don't bother with visuals or storytelling. Quantity over quality should be your mantra for failing on social media!\r  \n\r  \nCreating quality content is the most basic and the most important requirement for growing  your business through social media. Over the years I have seen several businesses with good overall business structure fail on social media just because they focus on quantity instead of quality of content they are putting in front of their potential customers.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the common pitfalls I've observed is the misconception that flooding social media channels with a high volume of posts will automatically translate into success. However, this approach often backfires, resulting in a cluttered feed devoid of substance and value. In the pursuit of quantity, businesses sacrifice the essence of effective communication: meaningful engagement with their audience.\r  \n\r  \nHere are few tips that you can follow to ensure content quality: \r  \n\r  \nInvest plenty of time in creating  high-quality visuals, including images, videos, and graphics, that capture attention and communicate your message effectively. \r  \nEngage your audience with compelling storytelling that evokes emotion, sparks curiosity, and fosters connections.\r  \nCreate content that is authentic, relevant, and aligned with your brand's values and objectives. \r  \n\r  \nAccording to a study by Sprout Social, 71% of consumers are more likely to recommend a brand to others if they have a positive experience with its social media content. This underscores the impact of quality content on customer mindset. \r  \n\r  \nConsumers crave authenticity, relevance, and value from the brands they follow on social media. By focusing on quality content that speaks to the needs and interests of your target audience, you demonstrate your commitment to delivering exceptional experiences and building lasting relationships.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n2) Buy Fake Followers\r  \n\r  \nOpt for shortcuts by purchasing fake followers or engagement. Sacrifice authenticity for vanity metrics. Remember, it's not about genuine connections; it's about appearing popular and watch your social media account plummet!\r  \n\r  \nAnother major mistake that I’ve observed businesses make is to give in to the temptation of artificially inflating follower counts through the purchase of fake followers. While the allure of seemingly rapid growth may be enticing, the repercussions of this shortcut are far-reaching and detrimental to your business's long-term success.\r  \n\r  \nWhen you buy fake followers, you're essentially paying for hollow numbers that carry no real value or engagement. These purchased followers are often bots or inactive accounts, devoid of any genuine interest in your brand or offerings. As a result, your engagement metrics remain stagnant, and your content fails to resonate with a genuinely interested audience.\r  \n\r  \nResearch from Trustpilot indicates that 78% of consumers view businesses with fake followers as untrustworthy, and 80% are unlikely to engage with their content. \r  \n\r  \nFurthermore, the algorithms used by social media platforms are sophisticated enough to detect and penalize accounts with a high proportion of fake followers. Inauthentic engagement signals are flagged as spammy behavior, resulting in reduced reach and visibility, making this strategy counterproductive in the long run.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n3) Overlook Platform Analytics:\r  \n\r  \nIgnore analytics and insights provided by social media platforms. Don't bother tracking metrics or analyzing performance. Blindly post content without understanding what resonates with your audience to make sure your engagement goes down the drain!\r  \n\r  \nIn the realm of social media marketing, overlooking analytics is akin to sailing blindfolded in a stormy sea. Yet, it's a mistake I've seen many businesses make time and time again. \r  \n\r  \nEffective social media marketing requires a nuanced understanding of what resonates with your audience and what falls flat. Analytics offer a treasure trove of information, revealing which posts garner the most engagement, what time of day your audience is most active, which demographics are most responsive, and much more. \r  \n\r  \nIn essence, overlooking analytics is a cardinal sin in the realm of social media marketing. It deprives you of invaluable insights, undermines your effectiveness, and leaves you adrift in a sea of uncertainty.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n4) Spam Your Audience:\r  \n\r  \nBombard your audience with constant promotional messages and sales pitches. Ignore the 80/20 rule and focus solely on self-promotion. After all, people love being sold to every minute of the day!\r  \n\r  \nSpamming your audience with incessant promotional messages is a common misstep that can sabotage your social media marketing efforts. In my experience, I've witnessed businesses fall into the pit of bombarding their followers with a barrage of sales pitches and self-promotional content. \r  \n\r  \nThis approach often yields diminishing returns and can have detrimental effects on your brand's reputation and relationship with your audience.\r  \n\r  \nEffective social media marketing is about building meaningful connections and fostering genuine engagement with your audience. By inundating your followers' feeds with relentless promotional content, you risk alienating them and eroding their trust in your brand. According to a study by Statista, 45% of social media users unfollow brands that post too many promotions or irrelevant content.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nBy following these four steps, you're guaranteed to fail with social media marketing in 2024. Remember, success on social media requires dedication, authenticity, and a genuine connection with your audience. \r  \n\r  \nP.S.  Feel free to ask questions and add more points in the comments!\r  \n\r  \nThankyou For Reading!\r  \n",

  "body": "Today from r/AskMarketing, We have this Gem:  \n\"What is the best way to get good paying clients for SMM ?\"  \nEvery answer I have seen before + my speculative opinions.  \n\"Treat yourself like a client\" 💼  \nI kind of hate this one, and usually on reddit people comment this as a cheeky dig at the OP.   \nWe often are so close to our core business, we fail to see how similar we are to our clients.
