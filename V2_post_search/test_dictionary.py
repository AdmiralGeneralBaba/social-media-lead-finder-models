I focused on building features that I wanted for the product. **THEN** after I've launched it and scaled it, I finally started asking for customer feedback.\n\n**Lesson Learned:** You don't have to always follow the grain!

If you ever watch it, you'll notice the sharks always harp on somebody if they still have a full-time job while running their business.\n\nMy full-time job pays over $300,000/year. It pays my mortgage and my bills. It also allows me to buy **whatever I want** for my business. I don't have to worry about how much revenue my business is bringing in because I'm already employed!

When I need some additional help, I'll pay someone in a foreign country on upwork $500 to do it.

  "body": "**Founder, Bobby Brannigan shares the story:**\n\n“It started at the end of my freshman year. I went to the bookstore to sell my books, as most students do, and they wouldn't buy half the books. So I asked the rep, *‘What do you want me to do with these books?’* She's like, *‘You can throw them in that pile over there.’*\n\nSo I look at the pile, I'm like, *‘Wait a second, can I have the pile?’* She's like, *‘Sure.’* So my friend and I brought them back to my room, and within a week and a half, I sold them for like $5,000 on eBay.\n\nThat was my *‘Oh sh\\*t’* moment.\n\nWhen I came back the next semester, I was like, *‘Okay, game time; I got to get my hands on a lot more books.’*\n\nMy first thought was, *‘Let me just put up posters around campus, in the dorm rooms, and the dorm bathrooms.’* I told the RAs and all over I would post these posters that I printed in the college library.\n\nIt said, *‘If you have books to sell, email me the ISBN numbers, and I'll give you a price. If you like it, I’ll pick them up, and you can give me cash.’*\n\n**Q: How successful were those posters in bringing in customers?**\n\nYeah, I think it was somewhere between like $500-800 a week in books I would buy, and I usually like double, triple, and quadruple my money. So, in the beginning, it was obviously pretty good.\n\n**Q: How much did you bootstrap the company with?**\n\nThat's a good question.\n\nThe amounts fluctuated because what we were doing was flipping textbooks along the way and generating profit. We made $5-7 million in profit to fund the development of the \\[textbook\\] marketplace. But we also had to borrow money to do so, and we did so in very unconventional ways. We were able to amass, I think, $250k in credit card debt, and we actually had a person who managed a baseball card binder with all the credit cards in it.\n\nSecond, my father let me take out a home equity loan on his house.\n\n\\[And third\\], we borrowed money from people, I'll call it, on the streets of Brooklyn, and if I didn't pay the people on the streets, I would have gotten my legs chopped off. So we were pretty extreme. I will say I was a very confident student. I didn't think anything could stop me. So, I took major risks.\n\n\\[But it was extremely stressful\\] I remember driving on the highway in Buffalo, on I-90, and I remember blacking out while I was driving. I woke up on the side of the highway and was like, ‘What the hell is this?’\n\nSo, a few months later, I put my friend Scott in charge of the textbook marketplace while I took a month off.\n\n**Q: How did you go from those few million in sales to that 85 million exit?**\n\nWhat I ended up doing for the first time ever in the company. It's kind of crazy. I started talking to the customer, and our customer was the merchant. One of the most memorable was a guy named James Barnes who flew out to Little Rock, Arkansas and had a steak dinner with him and his whole team, which was like 10 of them.\n\nI asked them, *'What can I do to help them grow your business?'* They said, *‘Help us buy more books. We don't care about selling books. We sell with you because you de-risk us from depending on Amazon. We'll buy an unlimited amount.'*\n\nI immediately had an idea. I said, *‘Alright, would you want to bid on them? If you could bid on them, would you be okay with getting them in four months? And would you be able to give us a price four months in advance that we could power rentals with?’*\n\nThat seems good. Let's do it. That was our moment where it's like, Oh my gosh, for seven years, I've been begging people to get in the marketplace. And now they're coming up like texting me, calling me, LinkedIn messaging me, *‘Can I be a part of this bid opportunity?’* So, that's what grew the company. It was purely innovation and asking the customer what they wanted.\n\n**Q: What was the story of when you decided to sell the business? How did that go?**\n\nWell, at that point, I had everything in the company. I wasn’t borrowing money from the scary people in Brooklyn anymore but I still had a home equity line at my parents’ house, and credit card debt, and like all these things. And all of my money was in the company, right? Like everything. So we're like, *‘What do we do?’*\n\nSo, we started searching. We hired a banker. We talked to a bunch of people, and we found an unconventional opportunity. We ended up finding a company in Boston that was kind of like the kayak for student loans, and the founder of that company had a vision to partner. We ended up getting acquired by them, and they eventually got acquired by LendingTree.\n\nBut, it ended up being a great, great partnership because they had been in student loans for a long time, and they had other ways of getting traffic, and they had millions of customers, too.\n\n**Q: How did it feel when you sold for tens of millions of dollars?**\n\n\"It felt amazing. When that wire hit my account. I remember pumping in my headphones. I'm walking around Boston, blasting It Was All A Dream by Biggie Smalls on my headphones and just walking like I could have been floating.\"\n\nEvery week I interview entrepreneurs to inspire to inspire the next generation of founders.

That was our moment where it&amp;#39;s like, Oh my gosh, for seven years, I&amp;#39;ve been begging people to get in the marketplace. And now they&amp;#39;re coming up like texting me, calling me, LinkedIn messaging me, &lt;em&gt;‘Can I be a part of this bid opportunity?’&lt;/em&gt; So, that&amp;#39;s what grew the company. It was purely innovation and asking the customer what they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What was the story of when you decided to sell the business? How did that go?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, at that point, I had everything in the company. I wasn’t borrowing money from the scary people in Brooklyn anymore but I still had a home equity line at my parents’ house, and credit card debt, and like all these things. And all of my money was in the company, right? Like everything. So we&amp;#39;re like, &lt;em&gt;‘What do we do?’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, we started searching. We hired a banker. We talked to a bunch of people, and we found an unconventional opportunity. We ended up finding a company in Boston that was kind of like the kayak for student loans, and the founder of that company had a vision to partner. We ended up getting acquired by them, and they eventually got acquired by LendingTree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, it ended up being a great, great partnership because they had been in student loans for a long time, and they had other ways of getting traffic, and they had millions of customers, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How did it feel when you sold for tens of millions of dollars?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It felt amazing. When that wire hit my account. I remember pumping in my headphones. I&amp;#39;m walking around Boston, blasting It Was All A Dream by Biggie Smalls on my headphones and just walking like I could have been floating.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every week I interview entrepreneurs to inspire to inspire the next generation of founders.

I'm a full stack developer and the project ended up being far more front-end heavy and time consuming than initially expected, so I've been putting long hours into getting the product ready.\n\nDespite this, I made tremendous progress over the past several months.

The non-technical founder took it badly and demanded that we both get off the project so he can find other developers to finish it.\n\nThe non-technical co-founder came to us with terms for a breakup. He claims that he talked to experts and investors in his industry and they advised him that we need to give up all our equity to him for a sum of cash, contingent on him making the company profitable, or the project won't be viable to other investors. Given the amount of time and effort I put in on both development and planning the business out, this amount is essentially insulting.\n\nWhen I told him that it was insulting given how much effort I've put in and that I want to retain some equity, his response was there was a 0% chance the project would be sellable to investors if I was still on it so I had to choose between the cash or nothing.\n\nNeither me nor the other co-founder want to give up all our equity, nor were we interested in leaving the project in the first place.\n\nThis project is intended for a relatively niche market that neither of us technical founders have experience in, so the non-technical founder is valuable to the project too because of his industry experience and contacts. All us are.\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed here. I think the non-technical founder is getting bad advice. Realistically, I would like to continue working on the project, just with a job as well.\n\nIt's a messy situation for sure.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice here for me on how to handle a startup breakup? I still believe the project can absolutely succeed, but the non-technical founder is not budging from his position of breaking the project up. I'm not sure if giving up all my equity for a small sum of money is normal. I'd rather retain some equity for all the work I put in.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",

  "communityName": "r/startups",
  "parsedCommunityName": "startups",
  "body": "Hey there! I've been reading some fire insights from this subreddit over the months. I've put into practice a couple of strategies that have enhanced my startup. It's great to see a community come together.\r\n\r\nI wanted to share the insights that have helped me remain successful over the years and have enabled others to achieve success through diverse training and coaching. It's probably not catered to all fields, hopefully there is value all around.\r\n\r\nGreat for people just starting out in sales, and some content for experts alike.\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\n**20 Years Later, The Handbook I Wish I had.**\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\n**Consider this:** When engaging with a customer, am I listening within the context of a conversation, or am I tuned in specifically for trigger words that I can leverage to drive the sale?\r\n\r\n**What can I take away from this?**\r\nDiscover practical tips, self-checks, and self-reflecting questions to enhance your self-awareness and effectiveness in selling. Mastering the art of sales lies in the customer experience; by utilizing product knowledge, and adapting to the ever-changing variables in your field. Talk to customers with authenticity, like how you talk to others.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n  \r\n**How many can you answer yes to:**  \r\nAre you equipped to handle any objection that comes your way?  \r\nCan you confidently close deals with anyone, no matter how complicated or detailed something is?  \r\nAre you equipped to offer solutions and a benefit?  \r\nCan you close deals with diverse clients?  \r\nAre you skilled in adapting your sales approach to different personalities, industries, trends, and market segments?\r\n\r\nWith time, everything changes. Just because we’re equipped today, doesn’t mean we’re ready for tomorrow. Each day is a new day to self-discover, adapt, and proactively execute towards success.\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\n**#1 Sales Pinnacle \\~ Knowing Your Worth!**\r\n\r\n______  \r\n\r\n*The reflection of your value is closely connected to how effectively you utilize your product to enhance the overall customer experience.*\r\n\r\n**Listen with Intention &amp; Close More.**  \r\nFrom a buyers perspective, they’re listening. They’re giving you attention (whether by email, or asking you a question) in relation to what you provide; service or product.\r\n\r\nWe’re all wired to say ‘no’ instinctually regardless if it's life saving. It requires a specific benefit or action that resonates with the customer for a successful purchase.\r\n\r\nAll it takes is the customer to think we’re not listening to start disengaging from the sale. Being connected while using simplified communication will usually get a ‘yes’ from the customer.\r\n\r\nWe are customers too. If a product was not working for our tastes, we are going to start questioning what we learned by what was read/told to us.\r\n\r\n*In sales, it's not just about selling yourself; it's about connecting yourself with the product, shaping a distinctive customer experience.*\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, your relationship with that customer is heavily controlled by the product you sold them. Ongoing relationships with customers is a different element and mindset. I will talk about that in another article.\r\n\r\n**Treat product knowledge like it’s your ammunition. You only get so many shots per customer.**\r\n\r\nCustomer:  \r\n\"I’m needing a laptop for my business. This is the laptop my friend told me about, but it is a bit out of my budget.\"\r\n\r\nSalesperson:  \r\n”Your friend really knows good laptops. I understand budget concerns are important. This laptop is not just a tool; it's an investment in your business's success. To make it budget-friendly, we've got a special discount going on, and we can explore some flexible financing options if interested. That way, you not only get the perfect laptop for your business but also stay within your budget. If this sounds great, would you like more details on financing, or are you leaning towards using the discount?\"\r\n\r\n**Never sell from your own wallet.**\r\n\r\nThe manner in which you sell a product shouldn't be influenced by your personal disagreement with the price. Don't let the price limit your ability to sell a product; when there's authentic interest, proactively explore solutions for the customer.\r\n\r\n**Information Overload.**\r\n\r\nHave you or your employer told you that you need to say specific things when a customer either walks into the store, emails us with a basic question, etc?\r\n\r\n**Some examples.**\r\n\r\nRetail | Store Front:\r\n\r\n“Hi welcome to ShirtsOrama. Just to let you know we have a sale on shirts. You can get an extra % off if you buy 3 or more, not that rack over there though. If you join our credit card you can save an additional 5% at checkout. How can I help you?”\r\n\r\nor this one…\r\n\r\nEcommerce | Store Front:  \r\n“Thanks for inquiring about our toothpastes. Did you know we also sell car washes and light bulbs?”\r\n\r\nor this…\r\n\r\nB2B | Ecommerce | Commercial | Logistics  \r\n“I see you ordered 1500 units of our beverage and you need the order expedited. Can I throw in 200 units of our newest flavor as it’s been popular with your competition?”\r\n\r\nCustomers don't remember much if they never asked for it. Merely saying hello, asking for something, or entering our stores doesn't mean we should bombard them with things or services.\r\n\r\nThe typical customer becomes disengaged when we start providing information that isn't directly relevant to their situation, often due to a perceived need or obligation to share unnecessary details. By this time the customer is already in a “no” defensive position, even if they're interested. Sharing information at key moments wields astronomically better results.\r\n\r\n**Emotional Selling.**\r\n\r\n***How do you balance the importance of the product and the personal connection in influencing/persuading customers to make a purchase?***  \r\nIf you would like to share, post your response in the comments.\r\n\r\nBalancing the product's importance with a personal connection is key to persuading customers.\r\n\r\nEmotional selling can be effective, creating a resonant connection. Yet, it's vital to gauge customer receptiveness, ensuring a pitch that strikes the right balance between emotional appeal and practical benefits.\r\n\r\nExcuses for emotional imbalances:\r\n\r\n* ”Depends on my day.”\r\n* ”Just not feeling it today.”\r\n* ”They weren’t buying anyways.”\r\n* ”I’m dealing with personal issues that are effecting my focus on sales.”\r\n* ”The tools available are impacting my solutions.”\r\n* ”The training is ineffective.”\r\n* ”The pricing strategy is hard to sell.”  \r\n\r\n\r\nExcuses are just that, decisions made without critical thinking.\r\n\r\n**Do we have days where we aren’t feeling it and are we allowed to have excuses?** Hell fcking yes we can. Just don’t make it a habit, and don’t set a tone doing it.\r\n\r\n**Breathing Exercise.**\r\n\r\nA simple 12 second breather where we can focus on getting through the present moment (eyes open):  \r\n\\~ Breathe in for 4 seconds  \r\n\\~ Hold it in for 4 seconds  \r\n\\~ Breathe out for 4 seconds\r\n\r\n**Tip For Staying Focused On The Day:**\r\n\r\nThinking about the Past will make me regret.  \r\nThinking about the Future will make me worry.  \r\nAll I’m left with is the Present, where I build the future and look back at accomplishments.\r\n\r\n*”The things you think about determine the quality of your mind.” \\~ Marcus Aurelius*\r\n\r\n**Ego &amp; Attitude Are 98% of What We Say &amp; Do.**\r\n\r\nYou can know your product better than your own phone number, but if your ego and attitude align elsewhere, good luck maintaining control of the sale.\r\n\r\nEgo and attitude can be both positive and negative. Positive ego includes confidence and self-awareness, while negative ego can lead to arrogance. A positive attitude often contributes to optimism, while a negative attitude may result in pessimism or closed-mindedness.\r\n\r\n**Ego &amp; Attitude Self-Checker.**  \r\nFor each scenario, act as a manager to your own brain, judge yourself on what came first to your mind, not what you think is the correct answer. In another way, judge your thoughts as a manager in the first 2 seconds after reading each scenario.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind you’re trying to ‘identify’ how you initially respond to each situation. This is about Self-Discovery, not right or wrong. Write down your answer for each one, then analyze and discover how much your ego &amp; attitude come into play.\r\n\r\n**Retail:**  \r\nCustomer walks in with ripped up sweat pants, a hoodie, shoes possibly made 20 years ago, and says they want to see “the biggest diamond ring in your display”.\r\n\r\n**Ecommerce | SAAS:**  \r\n”I want to buy this product, but only if you have a discount code?”\r\n\r\n**B2B:**  \r\n”I’m with So&amp;So Company. A friend over at Do&amp;Do Company says you gave him a good deal on your premium package. I want the same offer or I’ll go to your competitor.”\r\n\r\nTo deepen your self-discovery journey, examine your reactions at the beginning of each customer interaction. Pay attention to whether you respond with negativity or positivity and explore the reasons behind these reactions.\r\n\r\n**How to identify our Ego &amp; Attitude.**  \r\nPay attention to your actions and thoughts with each customer. You’ll soon start to notice what you do consistently (positive &amp; negative). As you pinpoint aspects of yourself that may need improvement, engage in critical thinking by asking insightful questions to analyze and understand them better.\r\n\r\n**Here’s some example questions to ask ourselves:**  \r\nAre there specific behaviors or thoughts that I consistently exhibit with customers?  \r\nDo I notice any patterns in how I approach different interactions?  \r\nCan I pinpoint moments where negative or questionable thoughts arise, and what triggers these responses?  \r\nIn what ways could I adjust my approach to create a more positive/friendly customer experience?  \r\nHow do I navigate instances where I recognize potential negative aspects in my interactions with customers?  \r\nStruggle with self identification? Ask professionally.\r\n\r\n**Here’s some questions we can ask our leaders and people around us:**  \r\nIn your observation of my interactions, have you noticed any consistent patterns or tendencies in my behavior with customers?  \r\nAre there specific triggers or scenarios that seem to influence my reactions or responses with customers?  \r\nBased on your observations, are there areas where I might be overlooking potential improvements in my customer interactions?  \r\nAre there cues or signals from customers that you've noticed, indicating potential areas for adjustment in my approach?  \r\nIn your role as a trainer or leader, what recommendations or strategies do you suggest for enhancing my overall effectiveness in customer interactions?\r\n\r\n**Identifying the Positive Ego within us.**  \r\nBy understanding how our ego influences interactions, we can adapt, listen genuinely, and provide tailored solutions. This self-awareness prevents potential pitfalls, fostering a collaborative and open sales environment, ultimately leading to more successful and satisfying customer relationships.\r\n\r\n**Identifying the Positive Attitude within us.**  \r\nA positive mindset not only enhances our resilience in the face of challenges but also attracts customers. Additionally, maintaining optimism helps navigate rejection and setbacks with grace, fostering a more resilient and motivated sales approach. In essence, a positive attitude is not just a personal trait; it's a powerful tool that contributes to customer satisfaction and overall success in the sales arena.\r\n\r\nHappiness, anger, sadness are all skills, not driven by external factors. And with any skill, they must be trained to become habit.\r\n\r\n**Judging Your Customers.**  \r\nIf you start judging your customer, you’ll be taken off your sales game and pulled in directions you shouldn’t be going. Even if we judge correctly, we do not want to make it a habit, because then negative Ego starts to creep up. It creates a barrier, hindering genuine connections, and can lead to assumptions that may not align with the customer's actual needs.\r\n\r\n*Recall the retail example with the ripped up sweat pants and hoodie asking to see the biggest ring in the case?*\r\n\r\nThat is a True story of my own sales experience from 2005. I was 21 years old and it was my very first sales job. I held certain perceptions about this couple. I asked for ID, which I would put inside the case. I held the ring more than they held it. I had more thoughts about them stealing than buying, etc. I talked about the ring, discussed the benefits while creating their story. In my mind, I was still always suspicious of them.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, they purchased that largest ring in the case, and to top it off, the gentleman proposed to his girlfriend right there in the store. They even became repeat customers, challenging my initial judgment and reinforcing the lesson that making assumptions about people can be misleading.\r\n\r\nHowever, we still want to have our respectable guard up, and still imply sensible common sense.  \r\n\r\n______ \r\n\r\n**#2 Sales Pinnacle: Handle Any Objection**\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\n*Handling an objection is only as good as the worth you provide overcoming it.*\r\n\r\n**Steer The Customer In The Sale.**\r\n\r\nHow often do you get tied up in longer than needed conversations with customers? This can happen when customers ask a lot of questions, or when we say things that make them confused, or they say something that confuses us. Then, more questions come up, and sometimes, neither we nor the customer really understand what's going on.\r\n\r\nSteering the sale comes with the best working benefit of them all; efficiency. By taking the lead, we can ensure that the customer receives information tailored to their needs, preventing information overload. This approach also enables the salesperson to strategically introduce products based on the customer's preferences and requirements, avoiding overwhelming them with unnecessary details, while staying focus on the sales process.\r\n\r\n**Never assume you know what the customer wants.**  \r\nAssuming what the customer wants hinders a genuine understanding of their actual needs, potentially overlooking opportunities for more significant sales.\r\n\r\nEach customer is unique, with varied needs, preferences, and challenges. Judging their requirements without a thorough understanding can lead to misconceptions and missed opportunities. This ensures that the customer feels heard, valued, and provided with tailored solutions, ultimately fostering genuine connections and increasing the likelihood of successful sales outcomes.\r\n\r\n**\\~ Product Perception**\r\n\r\nProduct perception involves how customers perceive the value and advantages of a product. It's about highlighting the positive aspects that align with customer needs and preferences. Ultimately, a salesperson's ability to effectively communicate the benefits and features tailored to the customer's perspective plays a crucial role in influencing their perception and, consequently, their decision to make a purchase.\r\n\r\nHandling objections with product perception involves addressing customer concerns by emphasizing the positive aspects and benefits of the product. By highlighting how the features cater to their needs and provide value, we can reshape the customer's perception, addressing objections and showcasing the product in a favorable light.\r\n\r\n**Shape The Customers Perception**\r\n\r\nCreating a need for the customer. We can do this by using data we extracted from the customers interactions or things they may have stated before. Using information to building a complete sale. If a customer wanted a flashlight to use at work, we would want to learn a few things:\r\n\r\n**Qualifying The Customer:**  \r\n“What do you do for work?”  \r\n”How often would you be using the flashlight?”  \r\n”Do you need to be hands-free with the flashlight?”  \r\n\r\n\r\nKnowing these things can help lead into the right product for the customer. On top of that, you’ll hear more information for further opportunities with the customer like; do they need one-time batteries or rechargeable, headlamp vs handheld, etc.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, understanding the significance of product perception and tailoring discussions to customers' needs can significantly impact the sales process. By focusing on the benefits and features that resonate with customers, we can preemptively address concerns, making objections easier to overcome. Moreover, this approach helps eliminate unnecessary objections that may arise due to a lack of alignment between the product and the customer's requirements. Ultimately, a customer-centric approach fosters a clearer understanding of the product, streamlines the objection-handling process, and enhances the likelihood of a successful sale.\r\n\r\n**\\~ Building Customer Integrity**\r\n\r\nBuilding customer integrity involves establishing and maintaining trust and honesty in interactions with customers. It requires consistent and transparent communication, delivering on promises, and ensuring that products or services meet or exceed customer expectations. By prioritizing integrity, businesses can cultivate long-term relationships, customer loyalty, and positive brand perception.\r\n\r\n**Respect Is Earned, Not Given.**  \r\nYou’re out shopping for a new jacket, you walk into the main store you wanted to shop at. You start to look at jackets and the sales rep comes over and says:\r\n\r\n“That does not look good on you, try this one, it’s our best seller.”\r\n\r\nHowever, this jacket you won’t even consider twice.\r\n\r\n**Don’t Be Weird.**  \r\nUnless in a technical environment, the “hovering effect” around customers only bolsters customers to feel uncomfortable and disengage from the sale. Don’t fake doing something just to do something. Go actually do something, and check in periodically with a proactive game plan.\r\n\r\n**Dead Air Is Not A Bad Thing, Embrace It.**  \r\nIf it’s quiet between you and the customer, that’s not an invitation someone needs to say anything. Just because your client hasn’t responded back, or your customer is still walking around the store, does not mean we need to just start talking.\r\n\r\nThe misconception that we must say something hampers constructive ideas that could enhance the sales process. If you feel the urge to say something, use that time to find something related to them, or to freshen up a new approach, just anything other than to poke.\r\n\r\n**Give Your Attention To The Customer.**  \r\nIt’s fine to be thinking about the sports game, or to go back to talking to your coworker, not replying back in a timely manner, or catching up on the texting conversation with someone. Just keep in mind, your customer interaction will make or break your entire career.\r\n\r\n**Five Power Advantages Both The Customer &amp; Sales Rep Earn:**  \r\n*Perception*  \r\n*Attentiveness*  \r\n*Engagement*  \r\n*Focus*  \r\n*Rapport*\r\n\r\n**\\~ Proactive Solutions**\r\n\r\nOffering proactive solutions is like being a superhero for your customers. Picture this: when they face a hurdle or share a concern, you swoop in with solutions before it even becomes a problem. It's not just about selling; it's about genuinely caring and making their lives easier. Wouldn’t you want the same?\r\n\r\n**How can I be ready to offer proactive solutions?**  \r\nKnow how to utilize product and shape it around your customers needs. Knowing product and how to use it effectively will make it easier to navigate objections by offering proactive solutions of the product for the customer. Additionally, active listening during interactions helps identify customer concerns to be able to align a product feature with that customers concern, and how it benefits.\r\n\r\nYou sell a pen. Can you sell 20 variations of how it can be sold using product utilization, and proactive solutions?\r\n\r\n“You said you need a dual purpose pen to correct papers, this pen can switch from back to red ink with one-button.”  \r\n”This pen will withstand and write in freezing temperatures while you’re working outside.”\r\n\r\n**Be Personable, Create Tailored / Personalized Solutions.**  \r\nUnderstanding the unique needs and preferences of each customer allows for the crafting of tailored and personalized solutions. This approach transforms the sales process from a one-size-fits-all model to a bespoke experience that resonates with customers on a personal level.\r\n\r\n**Product Utilization**\r\n\r\nProduct utilization also encompasses the ability of sales professionals to showcase how the product meets the customer's needs and addresses specific challenges, highlighting its value proposition.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how your product can benefit a customers needs for their value separates you from other sales experts.\r\n\r\nHere’s an example of two styles of selling with product utilization:\r\n\r\nSales Expert #1  \r\n“This product comes with a one year warranty.”\r\n\r\nSales Expert #2  \r\n“You mentioned you’ll be using it a lot. For your peace of mind, this product comes with a one year warranty.”\r\n\r\nBoth examples are the same thing. Why would one or the other be more effective?\r\n\r\n\\#1 stated to the customer a feature.  \r\n\\#2 stated the same feature but attached a personal connection from the customer.\r\n\r\nAttaching a personal connection from the customer with the product will lead to better results usually. It still all comes down to the connection you have with that customer.\r\n\r\n**The Art of Perfect Timing with Product Features.**\r\n\r\n“Don’t set off the fireworks before the timer ends.” “Do not spoil the movie.” “If you tell me the score I’ll unfriend you.” Sound familiar? This simple game changing strategy could 10x your sales game overnight.\r\n\r\nProduct utilization plays a crucial role in timing during sales. It's like knowing when to use the right tool at the right moment. Imagine a toolbox—each tool has its purpose, so, think of your product features as tools. Similarly, in sales, understanding your product features and using them at the opportune time enhances your customer’s experience. It's about providing solutions when they're most needed, making the sales process easier, impactful, and more efficient.\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\n**#3 Sales Pinnacle \\~ Close Comfortably**\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\nNever think about the end of the sale till it's official, or risk losing motivation and focus. Closing comfortably in sales involves concluding a deal or transaction in a way that feels natural, confident, and mutually beneficial for both the sales expert and the customer.\r\n\r\n**How do I know when I should start to close on the sale?**\r\n\r\nAsk preemptive closes, like:\r\n\r\n“When would you like the product to be delivered?”  \r\n”Based on our discussions, this product would the best for your needs. Should I add this to the invoice too?”  \r\n”How does using our product in a trial sound to you?”  \r\n”Are you choosing to use our credit card or your own form of payment?”\r\n\r\nThese preemptive closes serve as checkpoints to assess your customer's position in the sales process. Depending on the customer's response, you can determine the appropriate next steps, such as uncovering more about their needs, evaluating if they feel overwhelmed, or gauging their readiness to proceed with a purchase.\r\n\r\n**Never “Checkout” Till The Customer Says They’re Ready.**\r\n\r\nGet this misconception out of our heads as fast as possible. This will separate us from the competition. This will increase your lines on receipts, quantities, lines on invoices, bigger sales, etc.\r\n\r\nIt’s easier to close during a sales process than after they’re already agreed to buy their main product. How many times have you shopped and after you agreed to buy something the sales expert spews all this other stuff to apply to your purchase, like; protection plans, credit cards, upgrades, socks, batteries, etc. We tend to say 'no' instinctively, but effective presentation can guide customers out of that initial ‘no’ bubble and focus on our message during the sales process.\r\n\r\nHave you noticed an employee who acts a little more rushed after a customer says yes?  \r\n*If you notice it, do you think customers notice it?*\r\n\r\nThere is no need to rush to the checkout after a customer says yes. Let the customer tell you when they are ready. A ‘yes’ gives assurance and trust, and an opportunity to increase the sale.\r\n\r\n**Boost sales by doing it within the sales process, not just at checkout.**\r\n\r\nLet’s look more closely at how product utilization, timing, and closing come into play more effectively.\r\n\r\nWe’re selling a diamond ring. The customer will need to increase the ring size and strengthen the prongs, this will cost more in gold to do so, but under the lifetime protection plan, all maintenance costs are covered. Let’s not forget, in a year or two she’ll need to dip the ring to keep its nice white gold color, another maintenance cost covered under the plan\r\n\r\n“You mentioned the ring would have to be sized up and you asked us about reinforcing the prongs because she does hands-on-work, not an issue. Another reason people shop with us is our peace of mind lifetime protection. All those costs are covered under our lifetime plan. In addition, if she ever loses the diamond we’ll replace it at no charge. The lifetime protection is already paid for with the cost of the sizing and reinforcement of the prongs, $299 for the lifetime plan, compared to the $373 for our ale-carte services.\r\n\r\nNo brainer right? All our locations will make sure the ring is taken care of, even for a 1 minute pop-in cleaning. Are you leaning towards doing the 0% interest for 5 years with us, or using your own payment?”\r\n\r\n*Nothing implies checking out yet. We do not know the full scope of the buyers intentions.*\r\n\r\nAssess the customer's position, identify areas that require further discussion, pose additional qualifying questions, and emphasize customer benefits over features.\r\n\r\n**Have Conversations. Talk Like You, Not Like Someone Else.**\r\n\r\nDoes this ring a bell; you walk into a store or read an email, and it’s the standard boilerplate message, like you know the person has said it 84 times already that day.\r\n\r\n**Strategic Adaptation of Choosing How We Speak to Customers.**\r\n\r\nWhen spending time with friends, we often feel more relaxed, using casual language, expressing ourselves freely, and engaging in social interactions. It’s one way of building connections.\r\n\r\nIn a professional setting, individuals adopt a more formal demeanor, employing precise language, adhering to workplace etiquette, and engaging in structured interactions. This approach fosters a professional environment and supports effective communication within the workplace.\r\n\r\nMastering the art of communication in sales involves a strategic balance. Think of it like two gears – the casual side, where you connect with ease, using everyday language, and the professional side, polished and precise, following workplace norms.\r\n\r\nHere’s the simple answer when talking to customers – blend both. When engaging with customers, you bring in that genuine, friendly vibe, making them feel understood, all while maintaining the professional touch for clear communication. It's the sweet spot that resonates with customers, creating a connection that's both authentic and effective.\r\n\r\n**Scripts Are Just Cliff Notes.**\r\n\r\nUnless you’re trying to become a movie star that needs to memorize lines, you do not need to memorize an entire sales script. Unlike the movie, in sales, nothing is scripted.  \r\n*Do you talk in the way how the script is written?*\r\n\r\nSales scripts are tools used by sales experts to guide and structure their interactions with potential customers. They should be taken more as a cheat sheet for fine tuning and developing a sales approach that you find is successful.\r\n\r\nYour ceiling is so much higher than people who tell you:  \r\n“Read the script and you’ll be successful.”  \r\n“Do as I say, not as a I do.”  \r\n”What works for me will work for you too.”\r\n\r\nContinuously refine and practice, even with customers; persevere until you discover an efficient approach that still leads to success in your work.  \r\n**Fear of Rejection.**\r\n\r\nYou worked so hard on the sale and even pulled some strings to get it approved, and when the time came, they backed out and went with a competitor.\r\n\r\nIt’s a gut wrenching feeling, especially if a high commission was attached. Remember, this happens to the best of us, all the time. The one thing we need to make sure as sales experts, is to not expect anything in the sales world until it's official.\r\n\r\n*The fear of rejection usually stems from an attachment to outcomes beyond our control.*\r\n\r\n**How do I work on fear of rejection?**\r\n\r\nShift your focus from the outcome, to the process. It’s a profound understanding that rejection is not a reflection of our worth, but rather an inevitable aspect of the sales journey.\r\n\r\nReduced Emotional Attachment: Placing emphasis on the process helps in reducing emotional attachment to specific outcomes. Sales experts can detach from the fear of rejection by understanding that success is a result of consistent, well-executed processes.\r\n\r\nBuilding Resilience: Understanding that rejection is a part of the process fosters resilience. Sales experts can bounce back from setbacks more effectively, viewing each rejection as a stepping stone toward eventual success rather than a personal failure.\r\n\r\n**Expectations.**\r\n\r\nDon’t have them for anyone but yourself.\r\n\r\nThe moment you start expecting things of others, is the moment you surrender control of your own happiness and invite disappointment into your life. Keep expectations focused on personal growth, setting standards for yourself, and fostering a positive mindset.\r\n\r\nMy motto: Compete with yourself, and root for everyone else.\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\nI hope this article and its content has helped you in any way.

Mastering the art of sales lies in the customer experience; by utilizing product knowledge, and adapting to the ever-changing variables in your field. Talk to customers with authenticity, like how you talk to others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many can you answer yes to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nAre you equipped to handle any objection that comes your way?&lt;br/&gt;\nCan you confidently close deals with anyone, no matter how complicated or detailed something is?&lt;br/&gt;\nAre you equipped to offer solutions and a benefit?&lt;br/&gt;\nCan you close deals with diverse clients?&lt;br/&gt;\nAre you skilled in adapting your sales approach to different personalities, industries, trends, and market segments?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With time, everything changes. Just because we’re equipped today, doesn’t mean we’re ready for tomorrow.

They’re giving you attention (whether by email, or asking you a question) in relation to what you provide; service or product.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’re all wired to say ‘no’ instinctually regardless if it&amp;#39;s life saving. It requires a specific benefit or action that resonates with the customer for a successful purchase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All it takes is the customer to think we’re not listening to start disengaging from the sale. Being connected while using simplified communication will usually get a ‘yes’ from the customer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are customers too. If a product was not working for our tastes, we are going to start questioning what we learned by what was read/told to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In sales, it&amp;#39;s not just about selling yourself; it&amp;#39;s about connecting yourself with the product, shaping a distinctive customer experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, your relationship with that customer is heavily controlled by the product you sold them. Ongoing relationships with customers is a different element and mindset. I will talk about that in another article.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat product knowledge like it’s your ammunition. You only get so many shots per customer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customer:&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;quot;I’m needing a laptop for my business. This is the laptop my friend told me about, but it is a bit out of my budget.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Salesperson:&lt;br/&gt;\n”Your friend really knows good laptops. I understand budget concerns are important. This laptop is not just a tool; it&amp;#39;s an investment in your business&amp;#39;s success. To make it budget-friendly, we&amp;#39;ve got a special discount going on, and we can explore some flexible financing options if interested. That way, you not only get the perfect laptop for your business but also stay within your budget. If this sounds great, would you like more details on financing, or are you leaning towards using the discount?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never sell from your own wallet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The manner in which you sell a product shouldn&amp;#39;t be influenced by your personal disagreement with the price. Don&amp;#39;t let the price limit your ability to sell a product; when there&amp;#39;s authentic interest, proactively explore solutions for the customer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information Overload.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you or your employer told you that you need to say specific things when a customer either walks into the store, emails us with a basic question, etc?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some examples.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Retail | Store Front:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Hi welcome to ShirtsOrama. Just to let you know we have a sale on shirts. You can get an extra % off if you buy 3 or more, not that rack over there though. If you join our credit card you can save an additional 5% at checkout. How can I help you?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or this one…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ecommerce | Store Front:&lt;br/&gt;\n“Thanks for inquiring about our toothpastes. Did you know we also sell car washes and light bulbs?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or this…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B2B | Ecommerce | Commercial | Logistics&lt;br/&gt;\n“I see you ordered 1500 units of our beverage and you need the order expedited. Can I throw in 200 units of our newest flavor as it’s been popular with your competition?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customers don&amp;#39;t remember much if they never asked for it. Merely saying hello, asking for something, or entering our stores doesn&amp;#39;t mean we should bombard them with things or services.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The typical customer becomes disengaged when we start providing information that isn&amp;#39;t directly relevant to their situation, often due to a perceived need or obligation to share unnecessary details. By this time the customer is already in a “no” defensive position, even if they&amp;#39;re interested. Sharing information at key moments wields astronomically better results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Selling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you balance the importance of the product and the personal connection in influencing/persuading customers to make a purchase?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nIf you would like to share, post your response in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Balancing the product&amp;#39;s importance with a personal connection is key to persuading customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emotional selling can be effective, creating a resonant connection. Yet, it&amp;#39;s vital to gauge customer receptiveness, ensuring a pitch that strikes the right balance between emotional appeal and practical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Excuses for emotional imbalances:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;”Depends on my day.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;”Just not feeling it today.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;”They weren’t buying anyways.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;”I’m dealing with personal issues that are effecting my focus on sales.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;”The tools available are impacting my solutions.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;”The training is ineffective.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;”The pricing strategy is hard to sell.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Excuses are just that, decisions made without critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do we have days where we aren’t feeling it and are we allowed to have excuses?&lt;/strong&gt; Hell fcking yes we can. Just don’t make it a habit, and don’t set a tone doing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathing Exercise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A simple 12 second breather where we can focus on getting through the present moment (eyes open):&lt;br/&gt;\n~ Breathe in for 4 seconds&lt;br/&gt;\n~ Hold it in for 4 seconds&lt;br/&gt;\n~ Breathe out for 4 seconds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip For Staying Focused On The Day:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thinking about the Past will make me regret.&lt;br/&gt;\nThinking about the Future will make me worry.&lt;br/&gt;\nAll I’m left with is the Present, where I build the future and look back at accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;”The things you think about determine the quality of your mind.” ~ Marcus Aurelius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ego &amp;amp; Attitude Are 98% of What We Say &amp;amp; Do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can know your product better than your own phone number, but if your ego and attitude align elsewhere, good luck maintaining control of the sale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ego and attitude can be both positive and negative. Positive ego includes confidence and self-awareness, while negative ego can lead to arrogance. A positive attitude often contributes to optimism, while a negative attitude may result in pessimism or closed-mindedness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ego &amp;amp; Attitude Self-Checker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nFor each scenario, act as a manager to your own brain, judge yourself on what came first to your mind, not what you think is the correct answer. In another way, judge your thoughts as a manager in the first 2 seconds after reading each scenario.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind you’re trying to ‘identify’ how you initially respond to each situation. This is about Self-Discovery, not right or wrong. Write down your answer for each one, then analyze and discover how much your ego &amp;amp; attitude come into play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retail:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nCustomer walks in with ripped up sweat pants, a hoodie, shoes possibly made 20 years ago, and says they want to see “the biggest diamond ring in your display”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecommerce | SAAS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n”I want to buy this product, but only if you have a discount code?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B2B:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n”I’m with So&amp;amp;So Company. A friend over at Do&amp;amp;Do Company says you gave him a good deal on your premium package. I want the same offer or I’ll go to your competitor.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To deepen your self-discovery journey, examine your reactions at the beginning of each customer interaction. Pay attention to whether you respond with negativity or positivity and explore the reasons behind these reactions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to identify our Ego &amp;amp; Attitude.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nPay attention to your actions and thoughts with each customer. You’ll soon start to notice what you do consistently (positive &amp;amp; negative). As you pinpoint aspects of yourself that may need improvement, engage in critical thinking by asking insightful questions to analyze and understand them better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s some example questions to ask ourselves:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nAre there specific behaviors or thoughts that I consistently exhibit with customers?&lt;br/&gt;\nDo I notice any patterns in how I approach different interactions?&lt;br/&gt;\nCan I pinpoint moments where negative or questionable thoughts arise, and what triggers these responses?&lt;br/&gt;\nIn what ways could I adjust my approach to create a more positive/friendly customer experience?&lt;br/&gt;\nHow do I navigate instances where I recognize potential negative aspects in my interactions with customers?&lt;br/&gt;\nStruggle with self identification? Ask professionally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s some questions we can ask our leaders and people around us:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nIn your observation of my interactions, have you noticed any consistent patterns or tendencies in my behavior with customers?&lt;br/&gt;\nAre there specific triggers or scenarios that seem to influence my reactions or responses with customers?&lt;br/&gt;\nBased on your observations, are there areas where I might be overlooking potential improvements in my customer interactions?&lt;br/&gt;\nAre there cues or signals from customers that you&amp;#39;ve noticed, indicating potential areas for adjustment in my approach?&lt;br/&gt;\nIn your role as a trainer or leader, what recommendations or strategies do you suggest for enhancing my overall effectiveness in customer interactions?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying the Positive Ego within us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nBy understanding how our ego influences interactions, we can adapt, listen genuinely, and provide tailored solutions. This self-awareness prevents potential pitfalls, fostering a collaborative and open sales environment, ultimately leading to more successful and satisfying customer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying the Positive Attitude within us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nA positive mindset not only enhances our resilience in the face of challenges but also attracts customers. Additionally, maintaining optimism helps navigate rejection and setbacks with grace, fostering a more resilient and motivated sales approach. In essence, a positive attitude is not just a personal trait; it&amp;#39;s a powerful tool that contributes to customer satisfaction and overall success in the sales arena.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happiness, anger, sadness are all skills, not driven by external factors. And with any skill, they must be trained to become habit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judging Your Customers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nIf you start judging your customer, you’ll be taken off your sales game and pulled in directions you shouldn’t be going. Even if we judge correctly, we do not want to make it a habit, because then negative Ego starts to creep up. It creates a barrier, hindering genuine connections, and can lead to assumptions that may not align with the customer&amp;#39;s actual needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recall the retail example with the ripped up sweat pants and hoodie asking to see the biggest ring in the case?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is a True story of my own sales experience from 2005. I was 21 years old and it was my very first sales job. I held certain perceptions about this couple. I asked for ID, which I would put inside the case. I held the ring more than they held it. I had more thoughts about them stealing than buying, etc. I talked about the ring, discussed the benefits while creating their story. In my mind, I was still always suspicious of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, they purchased that largest ring in the case, and to top it off, the gentleman proposed to his girlfriend right there in the store. They even became repeat customers, challenging my initial judgment and reinforcing the lesson that making assumptions about people can be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, we still want to have our respectable guard up, and still imply sensible common sense.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2 Sales Pinnacle: Handle Any Objection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Handling an objection is only as good as the worth you provide overcoming it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steer The Customer In The Sale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How often do you get tied up in longer than needed conversations with customers? This can happen when customers ask a lot of questions, or when we say things that make them confused, or they say something that confuses us. Then, more questions come up, and sometimes, neither we nor the customer really understand what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Steering the sale comes with the best working benefit of them all; efficiency. By taking the lead, we can ensure that the customer receives information tailored to their needs, preventing information overload. This approach also enables the salesperson to strategically introduce products based on the customer&amp;#39;s preferences and requirements, avoiding overwhelming them with unnecessary details, while staying focus on the sales process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never assume you know what the customer wants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nAssuming what the customer wants hinders a genuine understanding of their actual needs, potentially overlooking opportunities for more significant sales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each customer is unique, with varied needs, preferences, and challenges. Judging their requirements without a thorough understanding can lead to misconceptions and missed opportunities. This ensures that the customer feels heard, valued, and provided with tailored solutions, ultimately fostering genuine connections and increasing the likelihood of successful sales outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~ Product Perception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Product perception involves how customers perceive the value and advantages of a product. It&amp;#39;s about highlighting the positive aspects that align with customer needs and preferences. Ultimately, a salesperson&amp;#39;s ability to effectively communicate the benefits and features tailored to the customer&amp;#39;s perspective plays a crucial role in influencing their perception and, consequently, their decision to make a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Handling objections with product perception involves addressing customer concerns by emphasizing the positive aspects and benefits of the product. By highlighting how the features cater to their needs and provide value, we can reshape the customer&amp;#39;s perception, addressing objections and showcasing the product in a favorable light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shape The Customers Perception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Creating a need for the customer. We can do this by using data we extracted from the customers interactions or things they may have stated before. Using information to building a complete sale. If a customer wanted a flashlight to use at work, we would want to learn a few things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifying The Customer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n“What do you do for work?”&lt;br/&gt;\n”How often would you be using the flashlight?”&lt;br/&gt;\n”Do you need to be hands-free with the flashlight?”  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing these things can help lead into the right product for the customer. On top of that, you’ll hear more information for further opportunities with the customer like; do they need one-time batteries or rechargeable, headlamp vs handheld, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, understanding the significance of product perception and tailoring discussions to customers&amp;#39; needs can significantly impact the sales process. By focusing on the benefits and features that resonate with customers, we can preemptively address concerns, making objections easier to overcome. Moreover, this approach helps eliminate unnecessary objections that may arise due to a lack of alignment between the product and the customer&amp;#39;s requirements. Ultimately, a customer-centric approach fosters a clearer understanding of the product, streamlines the objection-handling process, and enhances the likelihood of a successful sale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~ Building Customer Integrity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Building customer integrity involves establishing and maintaining trust and honesty in interactions with customers. It requires consistent and transparent communication, delivering on promises, and ensuring that products or services meet or exceed customer expectations. By prioritizing integrity, businesses can cultivate long-term relationships, customer loyalty, and positive brand perception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect Is Earned, Not Given.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nYou’re out shopping for a new jacket, you walk into the main store you wanted to shop at. You start to look at jackets and the sales rep comes over and says:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“That does not look good on you, try this one, it’s our best seller.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, this jacket you won’t even consider twice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Be Weird.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nUnless in a technical environment, the “hovering effect” around customers only bolsters customers to feel uncomfortable and disengage from the sale. Don’t fake doing something just to do something. Go actually do something, and check in periodically with a proactive game plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead Air Is Not A Bad Thing, Embrace It.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nIf it’s quiet between you and the customer, that’s not an invitation someone needs to say anything. Just because your client hasn’t responded back, or your customer is still walking around the store, does not mean we need to just start talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The misconception that we must say something hampers constructive ideas that could enhance the sales process. If you feel the urge to say something, use that time to find something related to them, or to freshen up a new approach, just anything other than to poke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give Your Attention To The Customer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nIt’s fine to be thinking about the sports game, or to go back to talking to your coworker, not replying back in a timely manner, or catching up on the texting conversation with someone. Just keep in mind, your customer interaction will make or break your entire career.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five Power Advantages Both The Customer &amp;amp; Sales Rep Earn:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Perception&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Attentiveness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Engagement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Focus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Rapport&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~ Proactive Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Offering proactive solutions is like being a superhero for your customers. Picture this: when they face a hurdle or share a concern, you swoop in with solutions before it even becomes a problem. It&amp;#39;s not just about selling; it&amp;#39;s about genuinely caring and making their lives easier. Wouldn’t you want the same?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I be ready to offer proactive solutions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nKnow how to utilize product and shape it around your customers needs. Knowing product and how to use it effectively will make it easier to navigate objections by offering proactive solutions of the product for the customer. Additionally, active listening during interactions helps identify customer concerns to be able to align a product feature with that customers concern, and how it benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You sell a pen. Can you sell 20 variations of how it can be sold using product utilization, and proactive solutions?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You said you need a dual purpose pen to correct papers, this pen can switch from back to red ink with one-button.”&lt;br/&gt;\n”This pen will withstand and write in freezing temperatures while you’re working outside.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Personable, Create Tailored / Personalized Solutions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nUnderstanding the unique needs and preferences of each customer allows for the crafting of tailored and personalized solutions. This approach transforms the sales process from a one-size-fits-all model to a bespoke experience that resonates with customers on a personal level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Utilization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Product utilization also encompasses the ability of sales professionals to showcase how the product meets the customer&amp;#39;s needs and addresses specific challenges, highlighting its value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Understanding how your product can benefit a customers needs for their value separates you from other sales experts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of two styles of selling with product utilization:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sales Expert #1&lt;br/&gt;\n“This product comes with a one year warranty.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sales Expert #2&lt;br/&gt;\n“You mentioned you’ll be using it a lot. For your peace of mind, this product comes with a one year warranty.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both examples are the same thing. Why would one or the other be more effective?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;#1 stated to the customer a feature.&lt;br/&gt;\n#2 stated the same feature but attached a personal connection from the customer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Attaching a personal connection from the customer with the product will lead to better results usually. It still all comes down to the connection you have with that customer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art of Perfect Timing with Product Features.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Don’t set off the fireworks before the timer ends.” “Do not spoil the movie.” “If you tell me the score I’ll unfriend you.” Sound familiar? This simple game changing strategy could 10x your sales game overnight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Product utilization plays a crucial role in timing during sales. It&amp;#39;s like knowing when to use the right tool at the right moment. Imagine a toolbox—each tool has its purpose, so, think of your product features as tools. Similarly, in sales, understanding your product features and using them at the opportune time enhances your customer’s experience. It&amp;#39;s about providing solutions when they&amp;#39;re most needed, making the sales process easier, impactful, and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3 Sales Pinnacle ~ Close Comfortably&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never think about the end of the sale till it&amp;#39;s official, or risk losing motivation and focus. Closing comfortably in sales involves concluding a deal or transaction in a way that feels natural, confident, and mutually beneficial for both the sales expert and the customer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I know when I should start to close on the sale?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ask preemptive closes, like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“When would you like the product to be delivered?”&lt;br/&gt;\n”Based on our discussions, this product would the best for your needs. Should I add this to the invoice too?”&lt;br/&gt;\n”How does using our product in a trial sound to you?”&lt;br/&gt;\n”Are you choosing to use our credit card or your own form of payment?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These preemptive closes serve as checkpoints to assess your customer&amp;#39;s position in the sales process. Depending on the customer&amp;#39;s response, you can determine the appropriate next steps, such as uncovering more about their needs, evaluating if they feel overwhelmed, or gauging their readiness to proceed with a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never “Checkout” Till The Customer Says They’re Ready.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get this misconception out of our heads as fast as possible. This will separate us from the competition. This will increase your lines on receipts, quantities, lines on invoices, bigger sales, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s easier to close during a sales process than after they’re already agreed to buy their main product. How many times have you shopped and after you agreed to buy something the sales expert spews all this other stuff to apply to your purchase, like; protection plans, credit cards, upgrades, socks, batteries, etc. We tend to say &amp;#39;no&amp;#39; instinctively, but effective presentation can guide customers out of that initial ‘no’ bubble and focus on our message during the sales process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed an employee who acts a little more rushed after a customer says yes?&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;If you notice it, do you think customers notice it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no need to rush to the checkout after a customer says yes. Let the customer tell you when they are ready. A ‘yes’ gives assurance and trust, and an opportunity to increase the sale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boost sales by doing it within the sales process, not just at checkout.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let’s look more closely at how product utilization, timing, and closing come into play more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’re selling a diamond ring. The customer will need to increase the ring size and strengthen the prongs, this will cost more in gold to do so, but under the lifetime protection plan, all maintenance costs are covered. Let’s not forget, in a year or two she’ll need to dip the ring to keep its nice white gold color, another maintenance cost covered under the plan&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You mentioned the ring would have to be sized up and you asked us about reinforcing the prongs because she does hands-on-work, not an issue. Another reason people shop with us is our peace of mind lifetime protection. All those costs are covered under our lifetime plan. In addition, if she ever loses the diamond we’ll replace it at no charge. The lifetime protection is already paid for with the cost of the sizing and reinforcement of the prongs, $299 for the lifetime plan, compared to the $373 for our ale-carte services.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No brainer right? All our locations will make sure the ring is taken care of, even for a 1 minute pop-in cleaning. Are you leaning towards doing the 0% interest for 5 years with us, or using your own payment?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing implies checking out yet. We do not know the full scope of the buyers intentions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assess the customer&amp;#39;s position, identify areas that require further discussion, pose additional qualifying questions, and emphasize customer benefits over features.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have Conversations. Talk Like You, Not Like Someone Else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does this ring a bell; you walk into a store or read an email, and it’s the standard boilerplate message, like you know the person has said it 84 times already that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Adaptation of Choosing How We Speak to Customers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When spending time with friends, we often feel more relaxed, using casual language, expressing ourselves freely, and engaging in social interactions. It’s one way of building connections.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a professional setting, individuals adopt a more formal demeanor, employing precise language, adhering to workplace etiquette, and engaging in structured interactions. This approach fosters a professional environment and supports effective communication within the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mastering the art of communication in sales involves a strategic balance. Think of it like two gears – the casual side, where you connect with ease, using everyday language, and the professional side, polished and precise, following workplace norms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s the simple answer when talking to customers – blend both. When engaging with customers, you bring in that genuine, friendly vibe, making them feel understood, all while maintaining the professional touch for clear communication. It&amp;#39;s the sweet spot that resonates with customers, creating a connection that&amp;#39;s both authentic and effective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scripts Are Just Cliff Notes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re trying to become a movie star that needs to memorize lines, you do not need to memorize an entire sales script. Unlike the movie, in sales, nothing is scripted.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Do you talk in the way how the script is written?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sales scripts are tools used by sales experts to guide and structure their interactions with potential customers. They should be taken more as a cheat sheet for fine tuning and developing a sales approach that you find is successful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your ceiling is so much higher than people who tell you:&lt;br/&gt;\n“Read the script and you’ll be successful.”&lt;br/&gt;\n“Do as I say, not as a I do.”&lt;br/&gt;\n”What works for me will work for you too.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continuously refine and practice, even with customers; persevere until you discover an efficient approach that still leads to success in your work.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Fear of Rejection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You worked so hard on the sale and even pulled some strings to get it approved, and when the time came, they backed out and went with a competitor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a gut wrenching feeling, especially if a high commission was attached. Remember, this happens to the best of us, all the time. The one thing we need to make sure as sales experts, is to not expect anything in the sales world until it&amp;#39;s official.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fear of rejection usually stems from an attachment to outcomes beyond our control.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I work on fear of rejection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shift your focus from the outcome, to the process. It’s a profound understanding that rejection is not a reflection of our worth, but rather an inevitable aspect of the sales journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reduced Emotional Attachment: Placing emphasis on the process helps in reducing emotional attachment to specific outcomes. Sales experts can detach from the fear of rejection by understanding that success is a result of consistent, well-executed processes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Building Resilience: Understanding that rejection is a part of the process fosters resilience. Sales experts can bounce back from setbacks more effectively, viewing each rejection as a stepping stone toward eventual success rather than a personal failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expectations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don’t have them for anyone but yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The moment you start expecting things of others, is the moment you surrender control of your own happiness and invite disappointment into your life. Keep expectations focused on personal growth, setting standards for yourself, and fostering a positive mindset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My motto: Compete with yourself, and root for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this article and its content has helped you in any way. Thank you again for reading and please feel free to reach out for questions &amp;amp; feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I've been utilising ChatGPT &amp; Grammarly AI to help enhance the consistency &amp; accuracy of my writing. Something I've historically really struggled with.\n\nThis is perhaps the most popular current use case for AI, but building your own GPT trained on your businesses resources that operates within predefined guidelines, has been a game changer. From supporting consistent tone of voice, proofreading human written copy &amp; turning one-line content ideas into an idea that's 80% of the way there is a game-changer.\n\nI've always been using this GPT for answering questions from tools like AnswerThePublic that relate to my brand to generate a plethora of SEO-focused content with significantly improved efficiency.\n\n***Sales Forecasting***\n\nNow this could be considered quick &amp; dirty, but we've been monitoring its effectiveness and it's been surprisingly accurate and has helped us to develop how we operate in this area.\n\nI've built once again a GPT trained on our historical sales data, market trends &amp; customer behavior patterns to provide insights on our current sales pipeline.\n\nNow this could be considered quick &amp; dirty, but we've been monitoring its effectiveness and it's been surprisingly accurate and has helped us to really develop how we operate in this area.\n\n***Chatbots***\n\nI can almost hear the boos from here, but they are effective. To be clear I'm not talking about the externally-facing rubbish support bots, like the one DPD in the UK deployed, which only went on to accurately describe itself as useless.\n\nWe've been using these internally instead, we trained a chatbot on all of our internal resources &amp; gave it access to all of our systems, and it acts like a co-pilot right there in Slack. I often interrogate it about previous deals, inbound leads etc, it also works like a more advanced search in our Google Drive. My organisational skills often leave a lot to be desired but this helps.\n\nWe've tried a couple of different tools for this (BotPress, ChatSpot, Zapier etc) and they all have their pros &amp; cons, but they all do pretty much essentially the same thing.\n\n***Feedback Analysis***\n\nWe're a small organisation so listening to our customers is super important, and being able to disseminate &amp; quantify large volumes of free text has been mega helpful, and allowed us to monitor trends and action this feedback, where previously we struggled &amp; would fixate on individual pieces of feedback rather than trends.\n\nTools like Pendo or Survicate work really well for feedback and surveys whilst Hootsuite and Pulsar are excellent for social listening. But these tools once again carry a hefty price tag and are built for scale.A more viable and cost-effective alternative to this would be to connect your data with a GPT trained to analyze the sentiment and to automate the capturing of this feedback in something like Airtable or even Google Sheets so that you can effectively monitor trends. This is what we've implemented, and has been working nicely!\n\nSo that's it - my quick &amp; dirty ways of utilizing AI in my business! Anyone else got any use cases they think would be helpful?

It it *not necessarily* to implement and utilize advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques. That's not to say that you can't or won't use ML/AI to inform business decisions, what I'm saying is that it's not always required to. Obviously this is going to depend on your company, their products, and role, but let's talk about a quintessential DS position at a quintessential company.\n\nI think the problem a lot of newer or prospective Data Scientists run into is that they learn all these advanced techniques and want to start using them right away. They apply them anywhere they can, kind of shoehorning them in and not having a clear idea of what it is they are even trying to accomplish in the first place. In other words, the tools lead the problem. Of course, the way it should be is that the problem leads the tools. I'm coming to find for like 50+% of the things I'm asked to do, a time series visualization, contingency tables, and histograms are sufficient to answer the question to the satisfaction of the business leaders. That's it. We're done, on to the next one. Start simple, if the simple techniques don't answer the question, then move on to the more advanced stuff. I speak from experience, of course.\n\nIn my opinion, understanding when to use simple tools vs when to break out the big guns is way harder then figuring out how to use the big guns. Even harder still is taking your findings and translating them into actual, actionable insights that a business can use. Okay, so you built a multi-layer CNN that models customer behavior? That's great, but what does the business do with it? For example, can you use it to identify customers who might buy more product with more advertising? Can you put a list of those customers on the CEO's desk? Could a simple regression model have done the same in 1/4 of the time? These are skills that take years to learn and so it's totally understandable for newer or prospective DSs to not have them. But they do not seem to be emphasized in a lot of degree programs or MOOCs. It seems to me like they just hand you a dataset and tell you what to do with it.

They work up from linear regression to coding and training a GPT chat model from scratch!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For each problem, I created a 5-10 minute background video covering the concepts needed to solve the problem (or quiz, for the topics that have multiple choice quizzes to go along with them) as well as a solution video.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the videos for the problems, and 2x a week concept overviews on different ML topics (suggestions welcome!) can be found on my channel: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@GPTandChill\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/@GPTandChill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem list can be found here &lt;a href=\"https://neetcode.io/practice?subpage=practice&amp;amp;tab=coreSkills&amp;amp;topic=Machine%20Learning\"&gt;https://neetcode.io/practice?subpage=practice&amp;amp;tab=coreSkills&amp;amp;topic=Machine%20Learning&lt;/a&gt; OR here &lt;a href=\"https://www.gptandchill.ai/leetcode-for-ml\"&gt;https://www.gptandchill.ai/leetcode-for-ml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here are Navi&amp;#39;s posts for some additional context:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://x.com/neetcode1/status/1756997643556041191?s=20\"&gt;https://x.com/neetcode1/status/1756997643556041191?s=20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7162822685037674496-i0Yo?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\"&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7162822685037674496-i0Yo?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let us know if you like this kind of educational content or have any feedback!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

They try to immediately launch a $5000+ service to cold audiences (can work, but it's hard going and will often have a longer consideration and purchase cycle)\n2. They invest in strategies like SEO that could take months to bring a positive return\n\nLet's say you've got a personal runway of 3 months to get some cash in before you've gotta get a job. \n\nYou start by selling a $5000 consultancy offer.  \n\nFor your target market, the average person would take 6 weeks to go from \"hey I found this potential service provider\" to \"we've got the approval to hire this person.\" \n\nHalf of your runway gone, right? \n\nAnd if you focus on long-term strategies like...\n\n* Growing a social audience\n* Organic traffic from search\n\nYou might have to wait another couple of months before you're actually attracting qualified buyers. \n\nYou'll have kept yourself busy working on the offer and content, but you'll run out of cash before any first payments come in.  \n\nWhen you're early stage you wanna be focused on making money ASAP so you can extend your runway and then work on getting those big payments.  \n\nWhat's the best way to do this? \n\nSell smaller services, offers, or products to get some cash coming in and extend that runway while you work on the big offer.  \n\nIn an ideal world you'd be able to break off a chunk of the \"big offer\" and sell it for a cheap, impulse purchase price. \n\nThis will help you generate cash and also generate a list of people who are willing to open their wallet for the big service. \n\nAs an example, I recently launched a new offer for a single dollar. \n\nWhy a dollar? \n\nIt has next to no friction for people, but still separates the people who think it's \"nice to have\" vs \"want the solution\". I also only promoted this in FB groups which I don't own nor have a reputation in.  \n\nIn 4 days it generated $319. \n\nOver the next 6 days one purchaser reached out for some light advisory work for $3750. \n\nTotal made over 10 days = $4069.  \n\nI've been in the game long enough I can put my ego aside and lower the prices I think I should be charging because I know the leads and buyers it generates will keep me fed on the back end. \n\nMost people want to skip the \"generating a little bit of cash\" and jump right ahead to the \"pay me loadsa cash\". \n\nI'm not saying you can't launch something new in a brand new niche and get $5000+ payments. \n\nPeople do.  \n\nWhat I am saying is it's hard to do that. \n\nIt's much easier to take a small hit on the cost today to generate high-intent leads you can upsell to down the road. \n\nInstant cashflow to keep things moving while you work on upselling people who buy the front end. \n\nThis isn't a new concept, it's just something a lot of people overlook. \n\nAny Qs, let me know.

A local government here in Estonia is looking for partners to develop a SPA center/hotel, and this announcement really speaks to me both professionally and personally.  \n**A Bit About Me:**  \nMy current business involves supplying promotional goods and items like hotel slippers to various clients, including those in the hospitality industry. This has given me a unique insight into this sector, albeit from a different angle. On top of that, I am a huge SPA fan myself. I've always been drawn to the relaxation, wellness, and the sheer joy that SPA experiences offer.  \n**The Opportunity:**  \nWhen I learned about the local government's initiative, it immediately sparked my interest. The idea of being part of creating a new SPA center/hotel — a place where people can find peace, wellness, and relaxation — is incredibly appealing. I see it as a chance to blend my professional background with my personal passion for SPAs.  \n**What I'm Hoping to Find Out:**\n\n* **Interest and Viability**: Does the idea of developing a SPA center/hotel resonate with you? Do you think there's a market for another one, considering the unique angle we could bring? Advice on Getting Started: For those who have experience in launching or running a SPA or hotel, what were your initial steps? I'm looking for guidance on how to begin this journey.\n* **Building a Team**: Regarding team assembly, I have already started to consider involving locals who have a proven track record of successfully establishing SPA hotels. The idea is to tap into the wealth of experience right here in our community, leveraging their insights and expertise to ensure the success of this new venture.\n* **Funding and Investment**: One of the most crucial aspects – I don't currently have the funding to bring this project to life on my own. How do you approach finding and securing funding for such an endeavor? Are there investors out there who might be interested in a wellness-focused project like this? I'm keen to explore all avenues for outside investment, whether it's through traditional financing, venture capital, or crowdfunding.\n* **Your Thoughts and Suggestions:** I'm open to any insights, suggestions, or advice you might have. Whether it's about potential challenges, funding strategies, or tips for success, I'm all ears.",

With proper regulation it might be a recreational product though I wish it is more towards helping people to feel good.\n\nThe product takes more than a hundred steps (will be adjusting the procedures over time so could be lesser) to make and is in capsule form. 1 capsule is sufficient to experience the effect and 2 to 3 would make one euphoric. Not advisable to take more than that as it might start to be dissociative and hallucinative. \n\nIt is by no means perfect but should suffice as a MVP now. I’m running out of self-funded capital to continue the research. I want to start selling this product to earn some income so I can continue.\n\nThe next research is to remove the taste and smell so it could be used as an additives for cooking and baking.

Vaping is a possible direction too but that’s quite costly to research on so I set it aside first.\n\nI do not have knowledge and experience in business and currently spending most of my time in research.\n\nHow should I set up a simple business with this product? How should I pitch and explain for people to try the product? I could explain the long science details behind it but no customer would want to listen. \n\nI don’t think this could be patented as well since it’s not some synthesis from some corporate lab so how do I protect my formula? I’m not even sure how good is the demand for such a product to spend more costing to apply patents and what not. Maybe all I have been researching in ended up having no demand but anyhow I hope it could still help some people. \n\nI don’t think I can handle this business (if really can set up) alone as well with all the r&amp;d pilling up so where and how do I find business partners?

But recently one of the clients that I have worked for came up with a very specific request on urgent basis (wanted editors to make a UGC promotional video).

In app and website development part I did my best and made all the clients happy and made good relations and impressions with the clients.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although we used to always get few requests for digital marketing since the client, we made websites for where already running/starting a business or startup and would obviously need marketing services as well, but I always used to say that we DON’T do marketing sir. But recently one of the clients that I have worked for came up with a very specific request on urgent basis (wanted editors to make a UGC promotional video). I had a person in mind who could get that done. So, I took the money and got the work done for that guy. I was happy as I made some quick money (since website and app dev are hight ticket products and takes time to make money)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He came up with few more marketing requests and we got that done too. Now this guy is coming to us with even more marketing requests and have referred me in his group as well, so other guys are also coming to us for getting their marketing work done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here is the problem, I actually don’t do marketing, I just get that work done from someone else, now with this increased request for marketing I am not at all able to handle it. The guy whom I got the work done is also overwhelmed with work and he is also trying to expand/ hire new people (he was doing it all alone). What do I do now? How do I handle this? should I say that I don’t do marketing at all, but this would seriously downgrade my reputation in front of that guy and his network and I would loose on some projects. Or continue looking for marketing agencies and handle both tech and marketing projects all at once (I have hardly have any good marketing contacts in my network, especially content production and video editing for social media post which we are getting a lot of requests)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;any advice, suggestion or feedback would greatly be appreciated&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

  "body": "VCs spend a lot of time saying ‘no’ or ‘not yet’ to founders and sometimes the feedback leaves founders wondering what to do. I’m offering an interpretation of “VC speak” to help startup founders better understand what a VC may be thinking and how they might take on board this feedback to improve their chances of a successful raise. I’ll caveat this by saying I don’t claim to speak for all VCs and this is based on my experience with early-stage (pre-seed and seed) investing.  \n**“This is a feature, not a product”**   \n**What does it mean?** this may be phrased as a question such as “what if (large incumbent) were to do this?” This concern is around whether the proposed solution solves a meaningful problem or if it only solves a small or non-essential part of a larger problem. This goes to the defensibility of the solution and whether you can convince customers to switch if it only partly solves their problem.   \n**What can you do?** Interview potential customers to get an understanding of the scope of the problem that you’re targeting, what outcomes your customer is looking to achieve and test whether your proposed solution actually delivers on that core outcome. When discussing this with VCs, focus on your target customer’s user journey, articulate how it differentiates from the user journey for the incumbent’s target market and how your solution solves the (whole) problem better for your targeted customers.  \n**“Unit economics don’t work”**   \n**What does it mean?** broadly unit economics refers to gross margin i.e.  revenue per unit minus the direct costs to produce that unit. The investors are concerned that your business model will not make sense for your target market or that it would be too costly or time consuming to scale and meet the growth targets required.   \n**What can you do?** you may want to revisit your revenue assumptions to see if they are overestimated or even better - validate the price by acquiring paying customers. On the costs side, evaluate whether you’ve considered all costs directly related to the sale e.g. if you have a sales team working on commission and your forecast shows revenue going up but sales commission is flat, something may have been missed in the modelling. I would also look at your proposed channels to market and think about whether these are a good fit for your chosen target market and if they can become more efficient over time.  \n**“Come back when you have more traction”**   \n**What does it mean?** traction means different things to different investors and essentially this is a ‘catch all’ when investors are concerned about the risk of multiple areas of the business. A common example is when the investor is not convinced about whether you are in a large, fast growing market and your ability to capture that market. Another example may be that they don’t fully understand the problem space and are not convinced that your solution meets the user needs.   \n**What can you do?** I would specifically ask the investor what benchmarks they would expect for your business model and stage for you to raise and use this as a guide to what the VC may have concerns about and what metrics are important for you to track.   \n**“Not venture scale” or “Lifestyle business” or \"market isn't big enough\"**   \n**What does it mean?** A lot has been written about VC business models, the tl/dr is that investors are seeking opportunities that could 10x their investment to run their business and generate competitive returns for their LPs. This means they are searching for companies in large, fast growing markets (growing faster than their benchmarks), run by A+ teams, with excellent unit economics (each customer is profitable), that is solving a headache type problem for their customers and your solution is 10x better than the existing options. It’s asking for a lot! Startups fall somewhere along the spectrum here and just because your idea or business is not the right fit for VC investment, it doesn’t mean it’s not a good business idea or that it can’t provide a comfortable living for you and yours.  \n**What can you do?** You can ask them to share their insights about what would need to be True for this opportunity to reach venture scale, this may give you some insight into the areas they are concerned about and highlight areas that you can focus on communicating in future pitches.   \n**The unspoken feedback - “The team”**  \n**What does it mean?** A lot of early stage investors place the most importance on the founding team because, in reality there is a lack of reliable and meaningful data to evaluate a startup. However (apart from identifying skill gaps) almost none of the feedback given to founders will focus on the people involved. Investors are human and this feedback is really hard for anyone to give, so some investors shy away from it because of how confronting and uncomfortable it can be.   \nIn addition, VCs don’t want to crush your dreams or insult a founder only to realise they were wrong later and want to invest, so they may give any number of reasons to do with the business. But you may find that no matter what you do, you can’t move forward with this particular investor. VCs don’t have a crystal ball, what they do have is pattern matching. They see literally thousands of pitch decks and meet with hundreds of founders a year so over time, they build a feel for which founders are likely to be winners. Each VC will have their own mental model based on the type of founders they have had exposure to, and rightly or wrongly, new founders are subconsciously evaluated against that model.  \n\n\n**What can you do?** This isn’t something you can control, just something to be aware of. You can think of VCs like hiring managers, they’re trying to imagine working with you for the next 10+ years. Specifically, they may be thinking about whether you are likely to be able to sell to your target market (would they take you seriously, do you have the confidence to close deals, have you actually sold to this market before), whether you can hire a strong team (could you convince great talent to join a startup?), whether you will present well to other VCs for future rounds (although good VCs will help coach you and provide feedback on your pitches to help you succeed with this) and whether they could introduce you to their LPs (limited partners are essentially a VC’s boss and VCs will sometimes introduce founders and LPs if they think the LP can help the founder’s business in some way. The VC wants to have some confidence that you will leave a good impression on the LP, not leave them wondering why on earth they invested with this VC).   \nIf you find yourself not ‘clicking’ with VCs, I would have a think about your communication style and the type of people this would resonate with and review your approach to identifying the investors you want to work with. There are hundreds of investors with different personalities, skills, knowledge and networks so you need to find the right fit for you (just like a marriage). Look for VCs that have a keen interest in your space, learn about their fund and their background. It’s often easier to build rapport when you have parallels in your background or have shared life experiences that will enable them to resonate with you.   \nHope this was helpful and if you’ve received any other feedback that you’d like ideas on how to action, leave a comment below and I’ll try to help you out.",

  "body": "**Cross Entropy Loss for multi class classification, when the last layer is Softmax**\n\nThe misconception is that the network *only* learns from its prediction on the correct class\n\nIt is common online to see comments [like this one](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/20301/159699), that, while technically True, obfuscate the understanding of how a neural network updates its parameters after training on a single sample in multi-class classification. Other comments, [such as this one](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/31966/159699), [and this one](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/20296/cross-entropy-loss-explanation/24696#comment91209_24696), are flat out wrong. This makes studying this topic especially confusing, so I wanted to clear some things up.\n\n# The Common Misconception\n\n&gt;The Cross Entropy Loss function for a single sample can be written as 𝐿 = − **𝐲 ⋅** log( **𝐲̂** ) . Therefore the Loss is only dependent on the active class in the y-vector, because that will be the only nonzero term after the dot product.^((This part is True))  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Therefore the neural network only learns from its prediction on the correct class\n\n**That is not True!**\n\nMinimizing the loss function is the objective, but the learning is performed with the gradient of the loss function. More specifically, the parameter updates are given by the learning rate times the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the model parameters. Even though the Loss function will not change based on the predicted probabilities for the incorrect classes, its gradient does depend on those values.\n\nI can't really write equations here, but from *Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Charu C. Aggarwal*, the gradient for a **single layer network** (multinomial logistic regression)​ is given by\n\n∂L/∂W = {\n\nfor the correct class: -Xi ( 1 - ŷ )\n\nfor the incorrect class: Xi ŷ\n\n}\n\nor in matrix form:  ∂L/∂W = - Xi (y - ŷ)^(T)\n\nSo the gradient will be a matrix the same shape as the weight matrix.\n\nSo we can see that the model is penalized for:\n\n1. Predicting a small probability for the correct class\n2. Predicting a large probability for the incorrect class\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Generalizing to a multilayer network**\n\nThe gradient from a single training sample back propagates through each of the prediction neurons, to the specific weight vector pertaining to that neuron in the last weight matrix, as that is its only dependence. The overall weight matrix has k such vectors, for each of the classes. As the gradient back propagates further back into the network, the gradient on a singular weight element will be a sum of the k gradients originating at the prediction neurons.",

  "body": "Looking to get any thoughts on potential red-flags in a 12 month contract (paid hourly) Data Scientist position, if anyone here has had a similar experience.\n\nFor context, I'm currently working as a Business Analyst (1.75 years in) with decent data science  experience, but getting a bit tired of my current role. I was approached on LinkedIn by a very legit recruiter (president of a recruiting company with official website, strong placement record, etc), and the role he's targeting for me is a 12-month contract Data Scientist at a household-name company. He also placed the hiring manager for this job in their current role (VP-level) and has a close relationship with them. He also placed another Data Scientist under this hiring manger recently. The team he's hiring for is apparently fast-growing, and the business unit in general is expanding fast (new product offerings, etc), so it seems like he wants me to go through the process pretty quickly (first round with the hiring manager next week, followed by final technical round sometime). Before that, he wants to meet with me to align on hourly pay rate.\n\nI guess my only concerns are: \n\n1)  The job is fully remote, and I thought the data science job market isn't great right now, especially for fully remote and especially for a class of '22 grad (&lt;2 years experience). Almost seemed too good to be True.\n\n2) I have a good education/foundation in data science (also enrolled in part-time masters right now) but even within my current company/extended teams I know several people more qualified for this position. My contact said something to the extent of, 'the hiring manager would rather have someone slightly greener but with great foundations like you, rather than say someone in academia who's never worked with real-world problems'. \n\n3) Pay: in the intro call, he wanted to get a rough idea of my pay expectations. He pressed me for a number for what I was looking for in other roles, and I know you're never supposed to give a number right away, but I eventually caved and said $100k + reasonable bonus (which would already be a solid pay increase from my current job). We're meeting again to align on a final $/hour number which factors in extra pay for lack of benefits (going through rough math, we aligned on $75/hour as a reasonable target), and he said he would try to get me more if possible, but I just wonder if I'm being targeted as a 'cheap' labor right now compared to other more experienced hires.\n\nLong post, but thanks in advance!",

I took a lot away from the thread and i want to try again with a fresh take which incorporates the feedback and discussion from the last one. Let me know if you guys think this is closer to the mark and where you agree/disagree. \n\n**How might AI change Data Science?**\n\n* **AI tools need to work for Data Scientists first and foremost.** AI is not going to turn anyone into a Data Scientist magically overnight. Data professionals are ultimately the ones who will be analyzing the data and telling the story so the tools need to work for them. If the community and user base does not adopt a tool then it will never get traction. \n* **AI may provide productivity benefits for analysis but the data professional will still need to be in the driving seat.** There is a wide variety of different directions that an analysis can go and expecting it all to be automated is not realistic. Only if an AI tool can make someone more productive while still providing flexibility will it be adopted and useful. Github Copilot is a good example of this. \n* **Reducing the barrier to data access will result in more analysis and more data scientists, not less.** If the tools are successful at increasing productivity then we'll have more deeper analysis, and deeper analysis. As people suggested, this is similar to what happened when spreadsheets came on the scene, it did not automate away analysis jobs, instead the amount of analysis went up. \n* **Converting insights from analyses into more consumable formats (like email, slides, docs) should get easier with Gen AI.** Once the insights are available we should hopefully be able to publish in a bunch of different formats. This is still to be proved but appears to be one of the early value props of GenAI. \n\nFootnote about me: I love working with data. It's been the single thing that has helped me stand out in my 10+ year career in FAANG. I've started as business analyst then data scientist then data engineering then moved to a PM role on a data product. Now I'm consumer PM and guess what, data is how I figure out what is right to build for my product and what sets me apart. \n\nOriginal thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1amdu42/how\\_do\\_you\\_think\\_ai\\_will\\_change\\_data\\_science/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1amdu42/how_do_you_think_ai_will_change_data_science/)",

If the community and user base does not adopt a tool then it will never get traction. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI may provide productivity benefits for analysis but the data professional will still need to be in the driving seat.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a wide variety of different directions that an analysis can go and expecting it all to be automated is not realistic. Only if an AI tool can make someone more productive while still providing flexibility will it be adopted and useful. Github Copilot is a good example of this. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing the barrier to data access will result in more analysis and more data scientists, not less.&lt;/strong&gt; If the tools are successful at increasing productivity then we&amp;#39;ll have more deeper analysis, and deeper analysis. As people suggested, this is similar to what happened when spreadsheets came on the scene, it did not automate away analysis jobs, instead the amount of analysis went up. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Converting insights from analyses into more consumable formats (like email, slides, docs) should get easier with Gen AI.&lt;/strong&gt; Once the insights are available we should hopefully be able to publish in a bunch of different formats. This is still to be proved but appears to be one of the early value props of GenAI. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Footnote about me: I love working with data. It&amp;#39;s been the single thing that has helped me stand out in my 10+ year career in FAANG. I&amp;#39;ve started as business analyst then data scientist then data engineering then moved to a PM role on a data product. Now I&amp;#39;m consumer PM and guess what, data is how I figure out what is right to build for my product and what sets me apart. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Original thread: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1amdu42/how_do_you_think_ai_will_change_data_science/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1amdu42/how_do_you_think_ai_will_change_data_science/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

  "body": "Hello everyone!\n\nBefore I dive in, I want to share that in this post, I'll be discussing a project I'm currently working on. For those interested, I invite you to join my waiting list at [www.nesti.io](http://www.nesti.io/).\n\nTo provide some context, launching my first business was a challenging experience, particularly in the realm of lead generation. I attempted every strategy I could think of, from cold calling and LinkedIn spamming to engaging on Reddit. Unfortunately, none of these methods proved effective. However, everything changed when I implemented my first automated lead funnel. Surprisingly, I saw a significant success rate, with 6 out of every 100 cold outreach emails converting into a free trial user for my product. This was far more effective than any outcomes from the social media marketing product I was promoting.\n\nThis experience led me to a realization: why not turn this efficient process into a product itself? And that's exactly what I'm doing with Nesti.io. Nesti.io is a tool specifically designed to streamline your lead generation process by creating automated lead funnels through a suite of features that includes:\n\n1. Email warm-up.\n2. Customer profile creation, alongside automating prospecting and outbound emailing to leads, leveraging a database of 250 million B2B contacts.\n3. The development of high-converting squeeze pages, offering a choice of three lead magnets: an ebook, a how-to guide, and a whitepaper.\n4. The creation of a nurturing auto-responder email workflow to engage leads further down the funnel and convert them into customers.\n5. Lead journey reviews for straightforward qualification.\n\nThought this would be of interest to everyone here. Please find how you can build an automated lead funnel before [nesti.io](https://nesti.io) below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. First, make sure you properly set up your email technical settings to avoid spam filters: [**SPF**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5046457454861-Set-Up-Sender-Policy-Framework-SPF-Records-to-Authorize-Your-Emails) (A method for determining which email servers are authorized to send and receive emails for your organization). [**DKIM**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5046544644365-Set-Up-Domain-Keys-Identified-Mail-DKIM-to-Authenticate-Your-Email) (Secure method that scrambles and unscrambles emails sent to and from your organization, ensuring they can't be changed while they're on their way). [**DMARC**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5046576375437-Set-Up-Domain-based-Message-Authentication-Reporting-and-Conformance-DMARC-to-Authenticate-Your-Emails) (A way to decide what to do with emails that fail certain security checks, and to create reports to help stop fake emails from pretending to be from your organisation). To achieve this, please click on the titles that provide brilliant resources for each above.\n2. Make sure to warm up your emails. You can use tools like [Instantly.ai](http://instantly.ai/) or [trulyinbox](https://www.trulyinbox.com/) to achieve this at a much more effective and faster rate. The idea behind this is that the process gradually builds up your email's reputation with email providers by sending out a controlled number of emails over time. This helps to avoid being marked as spam and ensures your emails reach your recipients' inboxes. Using tools like [Instantly.ai](http://instantly.ai/) or [TrulyInbox](https://www.trulyinbox.com/) streamlines this process, making it more efficient and quicker to establish trust with email servers, thereby increasing the likelihood your messages are successfully delivered.\n3. Be efficient. Before sending emails on your own, using tools like [Apollo.io](http://apollo.io/) allows you to explore a vast database of 250 million individuals. It lets you set up an email sequence, enabling you to craft a series of emails that automatically send to a prospect if they don't engage with the first email. The concept is to send multiple touchpoints until the prospect engages and becomes a lead. Furthermore, you can automate this process with a feature called '[Plays](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/14296116597901-Plays-Overview),' which executes this entire process seamlessly.\n4. Email copy should be concise and clear. The prospect is primarily interested in how your product or service benefits them, and nothing else. It's essential to focus on the value proposition and how it addresses their needs or solves their problems. Ensure your call-to-action (CTA) is straightforward and actionable. If you're seeking a meeting, for instance, include a [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) link to make scheduling as easy as possible. Additionally, personalize your message to resonate with the recipient, demonstrating that you understand their unique challenges and how your offering can help. Use bullet points or brief paragraphs to highlight key benefits, making the email easier to scan. Remember, the goal is to engage the prospect with relevant information that prompts them to act, so keep your language simple, direct, and focused on the reader's interests and needs.\n5. Ensure that you are emailing the right decision-maker. Tailoring your message to address the specific challenges and opportunities relevant to their role within the organisation can significantly increase the impact of your communication.\n6. Stand out. Diversify your strategy by not just writing sales emails. Incorporating a variety of lead magnets, such as webinars, ebooks, free trials, and personalised consultations, to cater to the varied interests and informational needs of your target audience. This variety not only helps in attracting a broader audience but also in engaging prospects at different stages of the buyer's journey. For instance, rather than relying solely on standard sales emails, imagine providing a free guide accessible via a squeeze page, in exchange for a lead's email. This strategy ensures that those who opt-in are genuinely interested in resolving the issue your resource addresses. I found this approach significantly boosts engagement because it establishes a reciprocal relationship between you and the lead, where both parties benefit.\n7. After capturing the lead, it's crucial to develop nurturing sequences that progressively offer more detailed information that is relevant to the first free resource, seamlessly guiding prospects through the lead funnel toward making a purchase. Therefore a strong call to action for the final email is incredibly important, using tools like Mailchimp wich provides a clear template that directs the lead to your product or service.\n\nMy product will help you do this entire process.

This can help you align with the global goals and standards, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, as well as with the customer values and preferences.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How to Create and Manage Your AI Chatbots Using &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in creating and managing your own AI chatbots for your omni channel marketing strategy, you can use &lt;a href=\"https://www.longshot.ai/blog/linkedin-article-writing-tips\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt;, a platform that offers a range of features and integrations for your business needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longshot.ai/blog/linkedin-article-writing-tips\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; is a platform that allows you to create and manage AI chatbots for various purposes, such as booking appointments, generating content, or providing customer service. You can choose from different templates and objectives, or customize your own chatbot according to your preferences and goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the features and integrations that &lt;a href=\"https://www.longshot.ai/blog/linkedin-article-writing-tips\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; offers are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look-ahead calendar booking algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;: This feature allows you to schedule appointments with drastically improved accuracy for dates more than a week in advance. The algorithm uses advanced natural language processing and machine learning to analyze the context and intent of the conversation, and to find the best time slot for everyone involved.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved recovery mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;: This feature allows your chatbot to suggest better times after a failed booking attempt. The chatbot can also provide reasons for the failure, and ask for feedback from the user to improve its performance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced knowledge base use&lt;/strong&gt;: This feature allows your chatbot to look back further in the conversation to see what kinds of texts should be pulled in to the final main prompt. This way, your chatbot can provide more personalized and accurate responses, and avoid repeating or contradicting itself.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less abrasive follow-up message&lt;/strong&gt;: This feature allows you to edit your follow-up message to be less abrasive, and more polite and respectful. The message now uses a softer language, and provides options for the user to opt out or reschedule the appointment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure updates&lt;/strong&gt;: These updates include accommodating GHL V2 API, which is a new version of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.longshot.ai/blog/linkedin-articles-writing\"&gt;GoHighLevel&lt;/a&gt; integration that allows your chatbot to connect with various marketing and CRM tools, allowing users to modify their bot name from the Bot Settings page, which can help them customize and brand their chatbot, and eliminating the need to copy and paste any API keys during setup, which can simplify and streamline the chatbot installation process.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sneak peek of some things&lt;/strong&gt;: These are some of the things that are coming soon, such as external webhook integration, which can enable your chatbot to communicate with external services and applications via HTTP requests, OpenAI integration, which can lower the message cost by about 50% by using the &lt;a href=\"https://www.crowdcontent.com/blog/article-writing/how-to-write-an-article-on-a-linkedin-company-page/\"&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; API, which is a powerful and scalable platform for building AI chatbots, Google Calendar integration, which can enable conversational appointment booking with the custom appointment booking objective, which is a feature that allows your chatbot to guide the user through a series of questions and actions to book an appointment, Property Data integration, which can use the collected address information to pull in market value, lot size, and other property data, which can be useful for real estate chatbots, Anthropic integration, which can lower the message cost by about 50% and provide a backup model by using the [Anthropic] AI, which is a new and ambitious AI research company that aims to create general and trustworthy AI systems, Pinecone integration, which can connect your chatbot with your own vector database by using the [Pinecone] service, which is a scalable and fast platform for building and deploying vector-based applications, and Stripe integration, which can automate customer queries, payment links, and billing by using the [Stripe] API, which is a leading online payment processing platform.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/p5f6vjajjsgc1.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2e6a3a803208ff07b0a556d3bf2da2a0465f12ae\"&gt;updates coming soon www.theineedagent.ai &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AI chatbots are a powerful tool that can help you boost your omni channel marketing strategy in 2024, by offering a range of benefits, such as improved customer service, increased sales and conversions, enhanced customer engagement, optimized marketing campaigns, expanded reach and accessibility, streamlined operations and processes, innovative products and services, competitive advantage and differentiation, scalable and adaptable growth, and sustainable and ethical development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to create and manage your own AI chatbots for your omni channel marketing strategy, you can use &lt;a href=\"https://www.longshot.ai/blog/linkedin-article-writing-tips\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt;, a platform that offers a range of features and integrations for your business needs.

What do you love or hate about the SEO software you’ve used? Why did you pick it? I’m not looking for tips on developing the software, running a business, or marketing strategies – just your honest user experiences. Thanks in advance!\n\nHey everyone on r/startups,\n\nI’m in the midst of creating an SEO software, and I realized something important – what better way to make something useful than to ask the people who actually use these tools? That’s why I’m here.\n\nI’m not after advice on how to build the software (got that covered, thankfully!) nor am I here to get a lecture on the ‘do’s and don’ts’ of running a business or marketing strategies.

They are very patient with me and I'm also learning a lot from other people not in my department (Backend, DevOps etc). I do mostly ML engineering recently but overall I do a little bit of everything including Data Analysis, QA, SWE etc. I personally don't mind as I am learning a lot through the way but I feel very exhausted and fatigued. The environment is chaotic as expected from a startup, we do a lot of status meetings and like I said I am doing WAY more than my original responsibility. I am always late on tasks, been stuck on one for a month of rewriting the entire service and every time new issue comes up and I'm just driving my supervisor crazy because I always need help. I am sometimes struggling of total grasping of how some parts of the code works or sometimes forget things that were explained to me before because I've moved to new things. It's an entire mess and I am getting super desperate because I'm drowning and can't find the way up and no one approaches to take the task from me or help me.\n\nI did get positive feedback in the review meeting and I did make hella progress since I started there. I also know I'm strong technically and with a lot of theoretical knowledge and capabilities but I still have the feeling I am a drag on the team. Like I said I really love the job and the people, I don't make that much but it's great learning place and it's super important to me to do everything to not be released from it.\n\nJust wanted to consult with you if it's normal in your experience, and what should I do to not feel so lost.\n\nThank you guys",

[www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) is a powerful AI chat bot that can handle all the communication and coordination tasks for your appointment setting process. It can send texts, emails, social media messages, and respond to interested customers from ads campaigns. It can also read your CRM, diary, book and change appointments, and more.\n\n[www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) was developed by I Need Leads LTD, a digital marketing agency that specializes in the solar market. I Need Leads LTD has a team of experts who can create and manage your online advertising campaigns, using Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Microsoft Ads, and other platforms. They also offer other services, such as landing pages, website, graphics, video, and online articles, to boost your online presence and generate more leads.\n\nIn this article, I will show you some of the new features that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added to help you boost your business even more. These features are designed to enhance your customer experience, streamline your operations, and increase your conversions.\n\n### Prevent bot changes when refreshing pages\n\nOne of the new features that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added is the ability to prevent bot changes when refreshing pages. This means that your bot will maintain its consistency and avoid confusion for your customers. For example, if your customer is chatting with your bot and refreshes the page, the bot will resume the conversation from where it left off, instead of starting from the beginning. This way, your customer will not lose their progress or interest, and your bot will not repeat itself or miss any important information.\n\n### Improved bot sorting\n\nAnother new feature that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added is the improved bot sorting. This means that you can organize and manage multiple bots on a single account more easily. For example, you can sort your bots by name, date, status, or category, and filter them by keywords, tags, or ratings. This way, you can find and access your bots faster and more conveniently, and keep track of their performance and results.\n\n### Show phone numbers for white label sub-accounts\n\nAnother new feature that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added is the ability to show phone numbers for white label sub-accounts. This means that you can see more contact information for your sub-accounts, in addition to their emails. For example, if you are a white labeler who has created sub-accounts for your clients, you can see their phone numbers on your dashboard, and contact them more easily. This way, you can provide better support and communication to your clients, and build stronger relationships with them.\n\n### Customizable snapshot link for white label\n\nAnother new feature that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added is the customizable snapshot link for white label. This means that you can create a custom link for your bot snapshots, and direct your customers to your preferred location for accessing them. For example, if you are a white labeler who has created a bot for your client, you can create a custom link for the bot snapshot, and send it to your client. This way, your client can see the bot snapshot on your own website, or on a third-party platform, and get a preview of how the bot works and looks.\n\n### Selectable bot template for white label\n\nAnother new feature that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added is the selectable bot template for white label. This means that you can choose the bot template that your sub-accounts start with, and ensure consistency across your accounts. For example, if you are a white labeler who has created sub-accounts for your clients, you can choose the bot template that suits their industry and needs, and pre-fill it with relevant content and settings. This way, your clients can start with a ready-made bot, and customize it further according to their preferences.\n\n### Larger description pop-up\n\nAnother new feature that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added is the larger description pop-up. This means that you can see more text and details when you hover over the bot responses and issues. For example, if you are editing your bot, and you want to see the description of a response or an issue, you can hover over it, and see a larger pop-up that shows more information and explanation. This way, you can understand your bot better, and fix any problems or errors more easily.\n\n### Wait setting for back-to-back messaging\n\nAnother new feature that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added is the wait setting for back-to-back messaging. This means that you can delay the message processing of your bot, and merge subsequent messages for improved context and accuracy. For example, if your customer is typing multiple messages in a row, and you want your bot to process them as one message, you can set a wait time for your bot, and make it wait until the customer stops typing. This way, your bot will not respond to each message separately, but to the whole message as a whole, and provide a more relevant and accurate response.\n\n### Break down main prompt into sections\n\nAnother new feature that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added is the ability to break down the main prompt into sections. This means that you can segment the main prompt of your bot into Setting, Light FAQ, and Response sections, and enhance the clarity and knowledge base retrieval of your bot. For example, if you are creating your bot, and you want to define the main prompt of your bot, you can break it down into sections, and specify the setting, the light FAQ, and the response of your bot. This way, your bot will have a clear and structured main prompt, and be able to access and use the knowledge base more effectively.\n\n### Full white label\n\nAnother new feature that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added is the full white label option. This means that you can fully customize and brand your bot and your platform, and make it look like your own. For example, if you are a white labeler who wants to create and sell bots to your clients, you can fully white label your bot and your platform, and change the domain, site title, social share image, favicon, and description. This way, you can enhance your branding and reputation, and impress your clients with your own bot and platform.\n\n### Variable replacement in library items\n\nAnother new feature that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added is the variable replacement in library items. This means that you can replace variables within your knowledge base items, and maintain the dynamic functionality of your bot. For example, if you are creating your bot, and you want to use a library item that contains a variable, such as the customer name or the appointment date, you can replace the variable with the actual value, and make your bot more personalized and accurate. This way, your bot will not use generic or placeholder values, but real and specific values, and provide a better customer experience.\n\n### Bot search bar\n\nAnother new feature that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added is the bot search bar. This means that you can search for your bots by text input, and find and access them faster and more conveniently. For example, if you have multiple bots on your account, and you want to find a specific bot, you can type the bot name or keyword on the search bar, and see the matching results. This way, you can avoid scrolling through a long list of bots, and save time and effort.\n\n### Document upload knowledge base\n\nAnother new feature that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added is the document upload knowledge base. This means that you can upload documents to store FAQ information, and expand your knowledge base capabilities. For example, if you have documents that contain FAQ information, such as PDFs, Word files, or Excel files, you can upload them to your knowledge base, and make them accessible to your bot. This way, you can enrich your knowledge base with more sources and formats, and provide more information and answers to your customers.\n\n### Deploy one bot to multiple subaccounts\n\nAnother new feature that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added is the ability to deploy one bot to multiple subaccounts. This means that you can scale your business and streamline your operations, by deploying a single bot to multiple CRM (By I Need Leads LTD) subaccounts. For example, if you have a bot that you want to use for multiple CRM (By I Need Leads LTD) subaccounts, you can deploy it to all of them, and avoid creating and managing multiple bots. This way, you can save time and money, and ensure consistency and quality across your subaccounts.\n\n### Conversational appointment booking (CRM (By I Need Leads LTD))\n\nAnother new feature that [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/) has added is the conversational appointment booking (CRM (By I Need Leads LTD)). This means that you can integrate your bot with CRM (By I Need Leads LTD) calendars, and simplify your scheduling process. For example, if you have a CRM (By I Need Leads LTD) calendar that you use for booking appointments, you can connect it to your bot, and let your bot book appointments for you. Your bot will check your availability, offer time slots, and confirm bookings with your customers. Your bot will also update your CRM (By I Need Leads LTD) calendar accordingly, and sync your appointments with your systems.\n\nWe are very proud of the new features that we have added to [www.theineedagent.ai](http://www.theineedagent.ai/), and we hope that they will help you boost your business even more.

This means that you can organize and manage multiple bots on a single account more easily. For example, you can sort your bots by name, date, status, or category, and filter them by keywords, tags, or ratings. This way, you can find and access your bots faster and more conveniently, and keep track of their performance and results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Show phone numbers for white label sub-accounts&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; has added is the ability to show phone numbers for white label sub-accounts. This means that you can see more contact information for your sub-accounts, in addition to their emails. For example, if you are a white labeler who has created sub-accounts for your clients, you can see their phone numbers on your dashboard, and contact them more easily. This way, you can provide better support and communication to your clients, and build stronger relationships with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Customizable snapshot link for white label&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; has added is the customizable snapshot link for white label. This means that you can create a custom link for your bot snapshots, and direct your customers to your preferred location for accessing them. For example, if you are a white labeler who has created a bot for your client, you can create a custom link for the bot snapshot, and send it to your client. This way, your client can see the bot snapshot on your own website, or on a third-party platform, and get a preview of how the bot works and looks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Selectable bot template for white label&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; has added is the selectable bot template for white label. This means that you can choose the bot template that your sub-accounts start with, and ensure consistency across your accounts. For example, if you are a white labeler who has created sub-accounts for your clients, you can choose the bot template that suits their industry and needs, and pre-fill it with relevant content and settings. This way, your clients can start with a ready-made bot, and customize it further according to their preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Larger description pop-up&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; has added is the larger description pop-up. This means that you can see more text and details when you hover over the bot responses and issues. For example, if you are editing your bot, and you want to see the description of a response or an issue, you can hover over it, and see a larger pop-up that shows more information and explanation. This way, you can understand your bot better, and fix any problems or errors more easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Wait setting for back-to-back messaging&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; has added is the wait setting for back-to-back messaging. This means that you can delay the message processing of your bot, and merge subsequent messages for improved context and accuracy. For example, if your customer is typing multiple messages in a row, and you want your bot to process them as one message, you can set a wait time for your bot, and make it wait until the customer stops typing. This way, your bot will not respond to each message separately, but to the whole message as a whole, and provide a more relevant and accurate response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Break down main prompt into sections&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; has added is the ability to break down the main prompt into sections. This means that you can segment the main prompt of your bot into Setting, Light FAQ, and Response sections, and enhance the clarity and knowledge base retrieval of your bot. For example, if you are creating your bot, and you want to define the main prompt of your bot, you can break it down into sections, and specify the setting, the light FAQ, and the response of your bot. This way, your bot will have a clear and structured main prompt, and be able to access and use the knowledge base more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Full white label&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; has added is the full white label option. This means that you can fully customize and brand your bot and your platform, and make it look like your own. For example, if you are a white labeler who wants to create and sell bots to your clients, you can fully white label your bot and your platform, and change the domain, site title, social share image, favicon, and description. This way, you can enhance your branding and reputation, and impress your clients with your own bot and platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Variable replacement in library items&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; has added is the variable replacement in library items. This means that you can replace variables within your knowledge base items, and maintain the dynamic functionality of your bot. For example, if you are creating your bot, and you want to use a library item that contains a variable, such as the customer name or the appointment date, you can replace the variable with the actual value, and make your bot more personalized and accurate. This way, your bot will not use generic or placeholder values, but real and specific values, and provide a better customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Bot search bar&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; has added is the bot search bar. This means that you can search for your bots by text input, and find and access them faster and more conveniently. For example, if you have multiple bots on your account, and you want to find a specific bot, you can type the bot name or keyword on the search bar, and see the matching results. This way, you can avoid scrolling through a long list of bots, and save time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Document upload knowledge base&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; has added is the document upload knowledge base. This means that you can upload documents to store FAQ information, and expand your knowledge base capabilities. For example, if you have documents that contain FAQ information, such as PDFs, Word files, or Excel files, you can upload them to your knowledge base, and make them accessible to your bot. This way, you can enrich your knowledge base with more sources and formats, and provide more information and answers to your customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Deploy one bot to multiple subaccounts&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; has added is the ability to deploy one bot to multiple subaccounts. This means that you can scale your business and streamline your operations, by deploying a single bot to multiple CRM (By I Need Leads LTD) subaccounts. For example, if you have a bot that you want to use for multiple CRM (By I Need Leads LTD) subaccounts, you can deploy it to all of them, and avoid creating and managing multiple bots. This way, you can save time and money, and ensure consistency and quality across your subaccounts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Conversational appointment booking (CRM (By I Need Leads LTD))&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; has added is the conversational appointment booking (CRM (By I Need Leads LTD)). This means that you can integrate your bot with CRM (By I Need Leads LTD) calendars, and simplify your scheduling process. For example, if you have a CRM (By I Need Leads LTD) calendar that you use for booking appointments, you can connect it to your bot, and let your bot book appointments for you. Your bot will check your availability, offer time slots, and confirm bookings with your customers. Your bot will also update your CRM (By I Need Leads LTD) calendar accordingly, and sync your appointments with your systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are very proud of the new features that we have added to &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt;, and we hope that they will help you boost your business even more. These features are designed to enhance your customer experience, streamline your operations, and increase your conversions. They are also easy to use and implement, and you can start using them right away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://login.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;If you want to learn more about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;www.theineedagent.ai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://login.theineedagent.ai/\"&gt;and how it can help you set more appointments for your business, you can visit their website&lt;/a&gt; or contact them today.

If this isn't allowed here, my apologies.\n\nAnyways, I figured out a way to drive a ton of traffic to Amazon Associates. Unfortunately, I was new to their program and didn't realize Amazon likes to ban affiliates for no reason.\n\nI was able to get paid $10,000 up to November, then they banned my account January 1st. I was sitting on over $30,000 of unpaid commissions, which I lost permanently without any recourse.\n\nThey claim it's because \"I was driving traffic from a website that I don't own.\"\n\nApparently forums and Reddit are not allowed, no warning - no \"hey, please change this\"...just backstabbing from Amazon.\n\nI'm not alone, there's a lot of people talking about getting banned for no reason if you do a quick Google search.\n\n(Posts like this: [https://www.blackhatworld.com/seo/amazon-associates-account-banned-for-violation-lost-all-the-money.1559940/](https://www.blackhatworld.com/seo/amazon-associates-account-banned-for-violation-lost-all-the-money.1559940/))\n\nAnyways, as to why I'm making this post...I can create similar content on a site I control/own, but Amazon doesn't allow you to create another account if you get banned - or they'll ban it too.\n\n(Amazon requires SSN for tax purposes so I can't just create a new account...they can tell it's me.)\n\nI tried using a family member's account and computer, but they caught on and yeeted the account.\n\nBut basically since they didn't give me any chance to adjust my content, I wasn't able to do anything about it.\n\nClearly, I've stumbled across something that works, and I want to use this skill to its fullest potential.\n\nI'm looking for someone who will let me use their Amazon account in exchange for a cut. Yes, I'm putting my neck out on the line here and could easily get scammed.\n\nBut, the way I see it is if you scam me - I'll just stop driving traffic to those links. It is what it is.\n\nYou're effectively going to get a 20% cut for doing nothing besides letting me use your account, which is a really good deal.\n\nIf you're interested message me.
